</div>

<p>The meaning of creation is not understood
till dust stands erect in a living man.
That a great purpose was present from the
beginning, directing and controlling, there
can be no doubt. It presided over the
first nebulous mist that floated out to take
form in the foundations of the earth. It
measured and weighed the matter and
force necessary to form the globe. It determined
the elements required to do the
work lying through the years before it. It
assigned to them their laws, specific gravities
and affinities, and appointed, beforehand,
the combinations and collocations
they were capable of making.</p>

<p>But not till the atoms throbbed in a<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_4"></a>[4]</span>
human brain and beat in a human heart,
did the purpose, which had through the
ages run, stand out, defined and justified.
Then it was that the intention underneath
the drift of the ages spelled itself out in
the unity of thought, the freedom of choice,
and the capacity for love, potential in the
intellect, will, and heart of the first man.
He was the realization of an ideal, which
gave meaning to the long periods of preparation.
As the final expression of the
creative process, he was at once the interpreter
and the interpretation of all that
had gone before.</p>

<h3>I.</h3>

<p>Writers of a certain school have sought
to minify man’s place in nature. They say,
as Dr. Joseph Leconte well declares, that
he is very closely connected with, and forms
a most insignificant part of, nature—that he<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_5"></a>[5]</span>
has no kingdom of his own, but belongs to
the animal kingdom; that in the animal kingdom
he has no department of his own, but
belongs to the department of the vertebrates—along
with birds, reptiles, and fishes;
that in the department of the vertebrates
he has no privileged class of his own, but
belongs to the class of the mammals, along
with four-footed beasts; that in the class
of mammals he has no titled order of his
own, but belongs to the order of primates,
along with monkeys and baboons. His
conscience is but the resultant of fear and
instinct, slowly deposited through the years
of his evolution. Its imperiousness is self-constituted.
Its scepter it has usurped,
and, from the exhalations of its own rising
cowardice, it has woven the purple robes
which constitute the badge of its authority.
His morality consists of rules imposed by
his own prudence, and which have no sanctions
beyond the opinions of his class or tribe.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_6"></a>[6]</span>
His religion is determined by the physical
conditions which surround his life—his
geographical situation, the nature and configuration
of his soil, his climate, and his
food. Thus man is simply a natural product,
while the civilization which he has
produced is as much determined by the
physical conditions surrounding his life, as
the leaves and dates of the palm are determined
by the physical conditions surrounding
that tropical tree. The hopes and the
trials, the courage and the sacrifice of the
best men, as well as the ambitions and motives
of the worst, are put on a level with
the damps and winds. The one class is entitled
to no more credit for what is noble
and heroic, than is rain for nourishing the
crops; while the other deserves no more
rebuke for what is base and ignoble, than
the lightning for striking the Church and
killing the people. The love which expresses
itself in monuments to commemorate<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_7"></a>[7]</span>
the deeds of the good and the great,
and the condemnation which lifts itself into
jails to confine the criminal and the outlaw,
have, in the last analysis, the same meaning.
There is no sacred significance or obligations
rooted in divine sanctions, in either
the monuments or the jails. Both are but
fickle phases of the passing spirit.</p>

<p>The convictions of Moses, reproducing
themselves in the government, laws, literature,
morality, and religion of a great people,
conserving them through the ages as
examples of order and health, have no more
meaning than the sap which rises in some
monarch of the forest, to express itself in
leaves and fruit. The conceptions of duty,
which nerved the heart and inspired the
courage of the Apostle Paul, leading him
to plant churches in Asia Minor, to become
the seeds of modern civilization, were as
completely natural as the rising of the
waters of some mountain spring, to flow<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_8"></a>[8]</span>
over silver sands to the sea. The music of
Beethoven, the visions of Raphael, were but
as the vapor in the light of the morning
sun, beautiful, perhaps, as the rainbow, but
going out with the setting day. Whatever
of emotion or conscience they embodied,
signified no more than the colors of the
peach bloom, or the notes of the falling
cascade. However esteemed the valor
that risked life to break the reign of
oppression and murder, it was but a varying
form of the heartless ambition that
sought in strength to make it prevail.
The patriotism of Leonidas, giving up his
life to save his country, and the insane act
of Nero, swathing Christians in tar to light
his feast, were forward and reverse movements
of the same human spirit; both
natural, and both as unmoral as the electricity
that now strikes to destroy, and now
burns the malaria to save. No difference
is made between poison in the fangs of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_9"></a>[9]</span>
snakes, and mercy in the hearts of
men.</p>

<p>Back of nature there is no purpose, and
in its manifold combinations and adaptations
there is no design. It is only a vast
aggregate of unresting atoms, striking one
upon another, and without intention and
without purpose, forming pairs, clusters,
and groups, and thus assuming the shapes
we see. Why there happens to be order
instead of chaos hangs on the uncertain
turn of luck.</p>

<h3>II.</h3>

<p>If there is mind in the universe, and if
there is purpose in the order and movements
of the earth, then man is the culmination
of that purpose, and with reference
to him was the order constituted and the
movements determined. If there is naught
but matter and force, and these exist without
any directing or co-ordinating mind,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_10"></a>[10]</span>
then all things are without intention and
without reason. There is nothing good or
bad. Nothing is right or wrong. All
things are reduced to a meaningless level
of indifference. But matter and force bear
witness to mind. Matter is here we know;
and matter has not only form, extension,
impenetrability, for its qualities, but indestructibility.
Take the matter that enters
into the composition of the earth. The
amount of it is fixed and definite. It may
be expressed in pounds weight. Since the
beginning, not an atom has been added to
it, or taken from it. Its presence here is to
be accounted for. It either determined its
own existence, and the exact amount, in
pounds weight of that existence, or it was
determined by some principle or power
outside of itself, or within itself, called
mind. If it determined itself to be,
then it is intelligent, for self-determination
and self-action are the essential characteristics<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_11"></a>[11]</span>
of mind. Then intelligence is retained
by being transferred from something
called mind to something called matter.
But it has never been claimed that matter
is intelligent. Then it is not self-active
or self-determining, and waits on mind for
its existence and its movements.</p>

<p>Matter as plainly bears testimony of the
existence of mind, as to the existence of itself.
It is easier to believe that the earth
has taken the globular form and the circular
motion by the determinations of
mind, than to believe that through its own
determinations it has assumed a circumference
of twenty-five thousand miles, and
the regular task of wheeling on its axis
every twenty-four hours.</p>

<p>Not only is it impossible to account for
the exact amount of matter making up the
earth’s size and weight, without assuming
the power of a co-ordinating, determining
mind; but a still greater task is upon us,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_12"></a>[12]</span>
to account for the sixty odd original elements,
out of which all things in nature
are formed without mind. These elements
differ in quantity, quality, specific
gravity, and affinity. What determined
their number, their tendencies, and affinities?
Why something more than sixty;
no more, no less? Why so much of some,
so little of others? We must either conclude
that they determined themselves—that
they held a convention before they
existed, and resolved upon taking form
and motion, or else we must believe that
they were determined by some power,
other than themselves—by mind. If by
their own motion, oxygen, and iron, and
gold are what they are; then the elements
have the power of self-action and self-determination,
and are therefore intelligent.</p>

<p>The collocations these elements form
are more difficult still to be accounted for<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_13"></a>[13]</span>
without the agency of mind. Figures
piled up to the sun are not able to express
the possible combinations they are capable
of assuming. The possible combinations
of even twenty-four letters of the alphabet
could not be expressed in literature, filling
the world with books. Much greater
must be the number of combinations of
the original elements—the alphabet of
creation. It is to be remembered, too, that
they disagree on more of their sides than
they agree. They are by no means
equally congenial. Friendships and unions
between them are formed in accordance
with the most exact rule and affinity.
Does it not seem, then, that combinations
formed by chance would be mutually
incompatible, neutralizing, and destructive?
Would they not forever ferment
in ungoverned chaos? Yet we see them
dwelling together in the utmost unity, like
seeking like, and in the bonds of law and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_14"></a>[14]</span>
harmony, uniting in compound, mineral,
vegetable, animal, and the body of man
himself.</p>

<p>Were there as many of the letter <i>a</i>, as
there are atoms of oxygen; and as many
of the letter <i>b</i>, as there are atoms of hydrogen;
and were the letters of the alphabet
to be increased in proportion to their use,
until they should equal the atoms of all
the elements which enter into the composition
of the globe; how long would it take
these letters, stirred by some force like the
winds, to assume the form of such a poem
as Paradise Lost? We cannot believe that
all these letters, stirred by an unseen force
through infinite ages, would ever form a
sensible verse of poetry, or a rational verse
of prose. It is as difficult to understand
how the letters of the alphabet could ever
get into the rhythm of Paradise Lost, without
Milton’s mind, as to understand how
unconscious elements took the form of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_15"></a>[15]</span>
mountain, sea, grove, and globe; round,
articulate, and law abiding, without a great
co-ordinating mind.</p>

<p>The physical forces and energies bear
indubitable testimony to the existence of
mind, not only outside of themselves, but
in themselves and through themselves.
We have the force of gravitation, the
power which bodies have of attracting one
another in proportion to their mass, and
inversely as the squares of their distance;
in other words, that power which bodies
have of getting up mutually aggregative
motion, unless prevented by some other
power of an opposite nature. A body suspended
in the air is attracted toward the
earth by the force of gravitation. A
lump of sugar held over a cup of tea,
attracts into itself the water of the tea
cup. This is done by the force known as
capillarity. A piece of iron left exposed
attracts the particles of oxygen in the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_16"></a>[16]</span>
atmosphere. This is done by the force
known as chemical affinity. Why do bodies
attract one another in proportion to
their mass and inversely as the squares of
their distance? Why does a lump of sugar,
held close over a cup of water, attract the
particles of water into itself? Why does
a piece of iron in the atmosphere attract to
itself the oxygen? We are told it is because
of gravitation, capillarity, and chemical
affinity. How happens it that these
forces have methods of action known as
gravitation, capillarity, and chemical affinity?
They either determined themselves
to have them and to act in accordance with
them, or else some power other than themselves
determined these methods of action
for them.</p>

<p>The truth is, gravitation, capillarity, and
chemical affinity are but terms we use to
define the operations of mind. To name a
force and to find the formula in accordance<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_17"></a>[17]</span>
with which it works, is not to determine
the origin of its source. And because we
have, by observation and experiment, found
out the methods and the measures of the
mind’s working, is no good reason why we
should read mind out of the process altogether.
This is to mistake names for
causes; and to suppose when one learns
how a force acts, that he has also learned
what it is that acts.</p>

<p>A contemporary of Shakspere might
have observed the poet so closely in his
home at Stratford-upon-Avon, as to be able
to give to the world a detailed and exact
account of his habits of thought and
hours of study; but this would not have
kept the intelligent part of mankind from
believing that a great mind had embodied
itself in the immortal plays of Shakspere.</p>

<p>Heat, electricity, light, and magnetism
must also be expressions of mind, for the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_18"></a>[18]</span>
same reason that matter is an expression of
mind. To believe them self-determined, is
to believe them rational and intelligent.
This has never been claimed, hence our
only way of accounting for their existence
is to regard them as the determinations of
mind. We see them, day by day, lending
themselves to the uses and devices of man’s
thought, and expressions of thought they
must be.</p>

<h3>III.</h3>

<p>This whole subject resolves itself into
the question, Which is fundamental and
prior, mind or matter? If mind is fundamental
and prior, then there is design,
intention, and purpose in nature. If
matter is first and fundamental, there
is no such thing as design, intention,
or purpose anywhere. If mind is first
and fundamental, then man is the
end and aim of creation, for in him the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_19"></a>[19]</span>
mind that formed the earth finds a companion
and an interpreter. If matter is first
and fundamental, then the earth is as much
for crocodiles and wolves, as for men, and
the life of a human being is no better than
that of a lizard. If matter is fundamental,
it were better to be a crocodile or an elephant
than to be a man, for they have
more of the fundamental stuff of the universe
in their bodies; and their brains
generate none of that subtle something
called <i>mind</i>, which perpetually asks questions
that have no answer, and cherishes
beliefs that have no foundation. If matter
is fundamental, then we should trust our
faculties, in proportion as they are animal,
and deny them in proportion as they are
mental. Then the Neros and the Caligulas
were more rational in their sins, than the
Luthers and the Wesleys in their virtues.
By following their lusts, the former found
pleasure, of a low order of course, but in<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_20"></a>[20]</span>
the realm of the real; the latter, following
their convictions, found pleasure, of a
higher order it may be, but it was in a
false and unreal domain. It were better to
be true to the facts on the plain of the appetites,
than to be the silly victims of
fraud on the plain of the conscience and
the affections. But it is impossible that
men have been true as they have been degraded,
and false as they have been pure.
The design and purpose which has been
apparent in nature, and which men have
felt in conscience approving the right and
condemning the wrong, must be there. To
eliminate them, or to reason them away, is
to bring mental confusion, and to take
from the conviction and thought, which
have made civilization, the principles on
which they reposed, and by which they
were inspired.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_21"></a>[21]</span></p>

<h3>IV.</h3>

<p>Man has no deeper and surer impression
than that the world belongs to him
and was made for him. It is deepened
year by year, too, as he sees the relations
he sustains to it increase. No
more certainly are the walls, roof, and floor
of a house related to the comfort and protection
of the family, than are the elements,
forces, and seasons of nature related to the
well-being and civilization of man. Mountain
and sky, meadow and forest, the past
and the present are permeated with the
thought, or idea, of man, whether in the
first stages of progress, keeping beasts at
bay with sling or stone, or at a more advanced
period, tunneling the rivers and
digging down the mountains. Young or
old, child or man, nature stands ready to
serve him. Water from her skies flows
through his veins to and from his beating<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_22"></a>[22]</span>
heart. Trees and shrubs and herbs minister
to his pleasure and his ills. Rocks, and
timber, and steel lend themselves to his
service for house, hatchet, or chisel. When
he ascends sufficiently in the grade of civilization
to give expression to his conceptions
of beauty, he finds the colors in the
ores under his feet to embody his visions.
Would he illuminate his humble home at
night, there is the pine with its light-giving
tar. Does he live amid the plains, where
the pine does not grow, there is the ox
with his tallow ready to be made into candles.
Does he live on the coast, away
from the ox or the pine, there is the whale
with his oil. Does he want a better light
than pine, or tallow, or oil can give, there
are the coal beds, with their sunshine laid
up for his use for thousands of ages. Does
he wish to turn night into day, and make
his streets glow with the radiance of the
stars, there is electricity to be drawn from<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_23"></a>[23]</span>
its wide, mysterious fields, to serve his
growing desire. Would he cross the sea,
the winds lie ready to fill his canvas and
draw him from continent to continent.
Are the winds too slow, there is the heat,
stored in the mountains, ready to move his
engine and drive his wheel. Does he wish
to make himself ubiquitous, and send a
message across the sea, before a ship could
get out of port, there waits on him again
the mysterious lightning.</p>

<p>Nature teems with elements and forces
to wait on man’s every thought, to gratify
his every desire, and to respond to his
every aspiration. With all her wealth she
surrounds him, and in ten thousand ways
invites him to use it. The naturalist
Guyot said the hand of man prefigures his
destiny as an intelligent worker. So the
form of all continents and islands, the outlines
of all seas and coasts, contain the
idea of the human family. At a time,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_24"></a>[24]</span>
geologically about the same, the surface
conditions of the earth were prepared for
the advent of man. The great Himalaya
Mountain range was lifted up to prepare
an embosoming plain to serve as a cradle
for the human race. The long chain of
mountains running through the whole
length of the North and South American
continents was raised to prepare the way
for civilization on this side of the sea.
When the ocean beds were dug out and
the waters called off from a part of the
earth’s surface; when the mighty peaks
and the majestic turrets of the mountain
chains were lifted into the sky; when the
encompassing atmosphere was filled with
all life-replenishing elements and wrapped
about all oceans and shores; when the
poisonous forces destructive of man’s life
were locked up in soils and rocks; when
the meadows were sown with grasses, and
the hospitable arms of the trees were<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_25"></a>[25]</span>
loaded with fruit, then, upon the earth,
adorned and ready for his coming, man appeared.</p>

<h3>V.</h3>

<p>Considered as an embodiment of
thought, man is the only creature who can
interpret Nature. The ideas and principles
that fill his great books were gathered
from a study of her secrets and processes.
The first books on geology, giving the history
of the earth, its upheavals, changes,
and transformations, were written in the
rocks, sands, coal-beds, and shells of the
primal ages. The first books on chemistry
were written in the shape, sizes, affinities,
and specific gravities of the atoms which
enter into the composition of all natural
bodies. The first books on arithmetic, by
the knowledge of which man learns to
divide and conquer nature, were written in
the qualitative relations and movements of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_26"></a>[26]</span>
matter. The first books on astronomy
were written in the orbits and movements
of the heavenly bodies. The first books on
zoölogy were written in the structure and
habits of the lower animals. The books
that fill our libraries are but transcripts
from the original volumes written in rocks,
seas, flowers, and skies. Man is the only
being who can read and transcribe these
wonderful volumes. They lie unopened
and unknown till his interest is provoked.
Their language carries no meaning till
he comes to find it and to ponder it. The
herds that low amid the Alpine echoes
see, as well as the distinguished Tyndall,
the great glaciers, as they press with
slow and measured pace down the mountain
side; but their meaning, and the law
by which they move, is not known till the
man of science comes. To him, they speak
in awful and majestic terms. To the
sheep in the meadow, the grass means<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_27"></a>[27]</span>
nothing but food; to man, however, every
blade has a message, poetic and beautiful.</p>

<p>Considered as a home, this world was
made for man; in a thousand senses, it was
not made for any other creature. It is the
home of the oyster, but its wants are met
by a little basin in the sea. It is the home
of the elephant, but a few acres of Asiatic
jungle furnish the food and the conditions
necessary to its life. It is the home of the
bird, but give it a tree and a worm, and a
small circle of sky to fly around, and it
needs no more. But man needs it all.
For his hunger, the foods and the fruits of
its continents, oceans, and skies. For his
thirst, the waters of its thousand rills. For
his shelter and protection, all its woods.
For his thought, all its order and law.
For his ills, the tender ministry of all its
minerals and plants. He is related to it
all, and to be completely furnished must
be able to use it all.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_28"></a>[28]</span></p>

<p>Considered as a place of discipline, the
earth is for man, for he is the only creature
helped and advanced by discipline. The
beaver cuts his tree and builds his dam
to-day just as the beaver did in the first
year of his existence. He has had the discipline
that comes through work, but it has
not improved him nor elevated him. In
order that the bee may live, he must gather
his honey and build his cell. This is discipline.
But he never improves. He
never grows in culture or skill. The bee
that built his cell in the trees of paradise,
and gathered his honey from the flowers
that grew in the garden of Eden, knew as
well how to construct a cell according to
mathematical principles, and to pack it with
honey, as the Italian bee of the nineteenth
century, who stores his honey in a painted
gum prepared for him by man.</p>

<p>Monkeys in South America cross rivers
by twisting their tails, thus making bridges<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_29"></a>[29]</span>
of themselves. This is discipline and exercise
of a complex and marvelous sort, but
they devise no new ways of building
bridges. They do not increase in knowledge
or skill by their work. That he may
gain the means of subsistence, man is under
the necessity of work too. But his work
is to him a means of growth and knowledge.
His work has helped him forward,
and secured to him culture and skill.
Suggestions come to him, as he fells the
forest, as he plows the field, as he plants
the seed, and as he rows his dug-out.
These suggestions he turns to account. He
builds them into better axes for cutting the
trees, into better plow-stocks for breaking
the land, and into better boats for crossing
the sea.</p>

<p>By turning the suggestions he has received
into better methods, into improved
tools and machinery, he has come from the
dug-out to the ocean steamer; from the pack-mule<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_30"></a>[30]</span>
to the palace car; from the scythe-blade
to the mower and reaper; from the
stone and sling to the improved army gun;
from the spinning-wheel to the cotton-factory;
and from the foaming steed of the
flying messenger to the electric telegraph.</p>

<p>Because of the growth and improvement
he has received through work, the tom-tom
has long given place to the piano, and
the tent to the modern home. Through
struggle with nature, he has been piqued
into a determination to conquer her, to ferret
out her secrets, and master her processes.</p>

<p>The forces that oppose him he makes to
serve him. The river current, which forbids
him to cross, he utilizes to ferry him
over. He sets his sail in the wind blowing
eastward and avails himself of its power to
carry him westward. The waves that rise
to engulf him he turns into steam to outride
them. The winds draw his water, the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_31"></a>[31]</span>
river saws his plank. The tail of the beaver
is adjusted by nature to the mud he needs
to cement his dam; his tooth is already adjusted
to the hardness of the tree, so that
he cuts it down by instinct and without
thought. The eagle finds the air already
under his wings when he would fly, and his
talons already prepared to hold his food, or
to grasp a limb in the forest. The fish
finds itself in the beginning of its existence
in an element ready to respond to its fins,
and in the presence of food adapted to its
life. The lower animals find themselves at
the start in a world immediately adjusted to
their needs, so that they have only to use
their feet, their teeth, their horns, their claws,
their wings, and their fins, to conquer their
enemies and find their food. The animal is
wholly governed by natural law, and hence
has no history. He moves on nature’s
level, and is adjusted to her plains, her
forests, her seas, and her skies, without his<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_32"></a>[32]</span>
thought or his device. Man is not related
in the same outward, immediate way to
clothing, food, and fuel. His understanding,
it is true, corresponds to the scheme of
nature, but he must grow into this by
study, by insight, by hints, by the use of
faculties the lower animals do not possess.
As long as he remains on the plain
of the tiger and panther, and emulates their
stealthy step to creep upon his prey, or his
human foe, like them, he has no history.</p>

<p>The savage, perhaps, did master the mystery
of the dug-out and the birch-bark
canoe, but he had no place for his archives
but a hole in the ground, and no experience
but such as died with him. Man’s history
begins with the attempt to conquer Nature.
The contribution that Nature makes to
human civilization is that she sets herself
against his inward energies, as if to call
them out. She puts limitations about him,
that he may be prompted to rise above<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_33"></a>[33]</span>
them. The fury and storm of the sea provokes
his ingenuity to express itself in the
steamship. The peril to life and fortune
contained in the lightning’s flash, begets
the steel rod that disarms it. The distance
between the wheat that grows in one part
of the globe and the need for bread in another,
leads to the discovery of a method
of transportation that obliterates it. Civilization
is the expression that man has made
of himself in his attempts, through thought
and will, to effect the conquest of Nature.
This witnesses to the peculiar and magnificent
place which alone belongs to him
in nature.</p>

<p>It may be true that he has no kingdom
of his own, no privileged class of his own,
and no titled order of his own; but it can
hardly be disputed that he has a history of
his own. This history, written in the dim
glories of vast empires, in the rush of splendid
cities, in the age-long conflict between<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_34"></a>[34]</span>
good and evil, in the undying creed of
martyred faith, in the hope, fidelity, trial,
agony, triumph, and self-sacrifice of the
human race, bears witness to the fact, either
that the earth was made for man, or else
that he is the only creature upon it capable
of subduing it, transforming it, recreating
it, and appropriating it. If man is only a
natural product, the powers have certainly
been engaged in a marvelously intelligent
and complicated sort of conspiracy to advance
his interests and to serve his dominion.</p>

<p>Nothing but what we have been accustomed
to regard as design, intention, purpose,
is sufficient to account for the fact,
that the scheme of nature so completely
corresponds to the understanding of man
as to make it possible for him to command
and claim all her possessions for his own.</p>

<p>Men will never accept such a happy
coincidence as the work of chance. They<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_35"></a>[35]</span>
will, by the very structure of their minds,
believe that the scheme and the understanding,
which, through the process of
struggle and trial, grows into it, were intended,
by the Great Author of both, the
one for the other.</p>

<span class="smaller">THE PROVISION FOR THE PHYSICAL NATURE OF MAN.</span></h2>

</div>

<p>In the form of bread, using the term in
a wide generic sense, matter passes into
the service of man on the plane of human
life. By regular steps it is lifted and refined
and adjusted to correspondence with
human need and comfort. In its raw and
individual state, it is controlled by physical
force. From this crude condition it is
carried by chemical force to the order of
the mineral kingdom. From this plane, it
passes up through the agency of vital force
to the vegetable kingdom. Through the
power of vital force of a higher kind, it is
advanced to the animal kingdom. Here it
is ready for man, and yields itself to the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_40"></a>[40]</span>
uses of his life. From the time that vital
force enters the realm of nature, a process
of assimilation begins. The plant assimilates
the mineral, the animal assimilates the
plant, and man assimilates the animal.
Through regular gradations, matter passes
up from the bottom of nature into the
service of man, who stands at the top.
With each move upward it gets associated
with force of a higher kind. With each
advance its range gets wider and its movements
freer. In the form of bread, it is
sufficiently refined and sublimated to be
appropriated and utilized for food,
for shelter, for raiment, by the immortal
spirit of man. The necessity for food, for
clothing, for shelter, creates commerce, and
commerce accomplishes results far more
important than the production and distribution
of the temporal necessities of human
life. It brings men together; it establishes
relations. It is the wonderful institution<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_41"></a>[41]</span>
which, early in the history of the race, began
as a loom to catch up the separate threads
of individual life, to weave them into that
marvelous fabric called humanity. Ends of
an infinitely higher order are realized by the
production and exchange of the elements
of trade, than the satisfying of hunger with
bread, or the furnishing man with clothing
and shelter. The higher ends are the
essential and ordained ends. That we
may understand what an important part the
necessity for food has played in the progress
of man, it will be well to consider the significance
of the relations it first helped to
establish.</p>

<h3>I.</h3>

<p>All power whatever, that distinguishes
man from the brute, that in any respect
contributes to his commercial, mental,
moral, or human value, is due to union,
relation, action and interaction among individuals.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_42"></a>[42]</span>
In nature we may find illustrations
of this truth. Sound, electricity,
heat, and light, are forms of force which owe
their existence to action, relation, interaction
among material particles. They would
never arise in a universe of unrelated
elements. Their difference is due, not to
the vibration of different elements, but to
different rates of vibration among the same
elements. Consequent upon certain terms
of formal and quiet social intercourse among
the molecules, there is sound. When they
intermingle more actively and intimately,
there is electricity. With a slight change
in the method, but no decrease in the
velocity with which they move, there is heat.
When they go at the top of their speed,
waltzing and swinging corners at an unthinkable
rate, there is light. From varying
relations and actions among material
particles, we get the music which charms
us, the means of communication which<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_43"></a>[43]</span>
unite us, the power to do work
which serves us, and the beauty which
refines us. The unceasing play of these
simple unseen elements made the fame of
Beethoven, who threw their vibrations into
symphonies; and of Morse, who utilized
their speed to carry the news; and of Watt,
who hitched their radiations to the flying
train; and of Daguerre, who put their
undulations to painting pictures. All
forms of physical force may be traced to
the union, relation, and vibration of material
particles. The distance from atoms to
men is well-nigh infinite, but the points of
resemblance between the genesis of physical
force and the genesis of social force are
sufficiently striking to make it permissible
to trace the analogy between them. By
social force is understood all those forms
of energy which men find themselves to
possess by virtue of their relations to one
another in organized social life.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_44"></a>[44]</span></p>

<p>Commerce insures the union, and brings
about the relations that make this force
possible. It furnishes the conditions without
which it could not be.</p>

<p>A self-contained, self-included, insulated
person does carry within the depths of
his being the organs of the civilized man,
but they are as completely out of sight and
out of use as the harvests that sleep within
the kernels of the mummy wheat. If it
were possible for an individual to come to
years of maturity, out of relations with his
fellows, he would be more destitute than a
brute. Such an one, growing up in the
woods or on an island, with no associates
but the squirrels and the birds, would not
have the personal furnishments of the
monkey or the fox.</p>

<p>We can understand, too, by considering
what man owes to his relations, how widely
and completely he is separated from the
lower animals. A thousand blackbirds,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_45"></a>[45]</span>
living together in relation, are not different
from a thousand blackbirds living apart
and out of relation. A squirrel gains no
element of squirrelhood by companionship,
and loses no element of it in isolation.
He may be taken from his nest as soon as
he is born and never be permitted to see
another squirrel, but he will be just as
much of a squirrel, and know as well how
to get the meat out of a nut, as if free in
the forests with others of his kind. A
mocking bird comes to the power of song as
well in a cage, separated from other birds,
as when fed and trained in the orchard by
the mother-bird. The chords in his throat
were set to music, and without teacher or
praise, at a certain period of his growth,
his song will ring through the house.</p>

<p>The difference between a man brought up
in some lone woods, out of all relation with
men, and one brought up in a civilized
community, is infinite. The lower animals<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_46"></a>[46]</span>
get all they ever get by birth. No new
gifts or powers come to them through companionship.
They go unerringly to a
certain destined end, whether they move
in flocks or herds, or alone as individuals.
Men, on the other hand, find themselves by
coming together. Their organs sleep till
waked by relation. By birth they can get
nothing but the germs, the mere naked
elements of what they are to become.
Birth would be no blessing, but a deepening
curse, but for what comes to the child
through relation. Birthright alone is not
worth a mess of pottage. Men often congratulate
themselves on what they are
pleased to term their individual rights and
personal freedom. While men do have
individual rights and personal freedom,
it is always to be remembered that these
belong to them because of the relations
woven around them by the institutions
of social life. The civilized man differs<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_47"></a>[47]</span>
more from the savage, than the savage
differs from the highest animal. Yet
the lowest savage is infinitely removed
from the highest animal, but solely in the
possession of the germs of the attainments
and the accomplishments which may be
provoked and maintained by relation.
Society alone furnishes the soil in which
these germs can grow. The savage, alone in
the woods, might secure for himself a covering
of skins, but the cloth in which the
civilized man clothes himself is possible
only in social relations.</p>

<p>With the commencement of human
relations, the outlines of an absolutely
new world come into view. Dim and
vague at the outset, as the relations are
simple and low. But as these increase in
number, range, and degree, not only the
outlines, but the far-reaching surface, the
mountains, the rivers, the products, the
sky, and the climate of a new world stand<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_48"></a>[48]</span>
out clear, definite, and unmistakable.
This new realm we name <i>civilization</i>. It
is super-imposed upon the physical world,
but is as distinct from it as thought from
the molecules of the brain. Nature furnishes
the basis, but social relations furnish
the conditions of the human energy
that has lifted itself into the mighty edifice
we call civilization.</p>

<p>All genera and species and families and
individuals are so many forms in which
the radiant energy of the sun has deposited
itself. Playing with its heat and
its light upon soil, sea, and sky, the sun
has built the myriad organic forms we see.
So all objects, interests, and laws embraced
within the range of civilization are the
forms in which social force, arising through
relations, has deposited itself. Human
language itself is an embodiment of social
force. The grammars of different languages
actually advertise the social status<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_49"></a>[49]</span>
and condition of the peoples who used
them. In the Chinese language we have
no distinction as to parts of speech, thus
showing that the national consciousness
was arrested at the stage of paternalism in
government. The ancient Romans put
enormous stress upon the will. They formulated
the laws by which men are still
regulated in civilized social life. A hint
of this we get in the Latin language, by
the small use made of the pronoun. Ideas,
too, are expressions of translated social
energy. Nothing seems to be more insulated
than the human brain, by the aid of
which the mind does its thinking. Out of
sight and out of touch, within the dark
depths of its own mysterious home, it
would appear to be shut up to absolute
solitude. Here, at least, we would expect
to find individual, independent work. But
not so. No individual brain can think,
only as it uses the brains of others in the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_50"></a>[50]</span>
process. Homer’s Iliad is a poetic formulation
of what all Greece felt. The elements
of myth, thought, passion, which it
contains, were all in the contemporary
Greek mind. In committing this poem to
memory, the Greeks were but storing up
their own thoughts.</p>

<p>Hegel, in thinking out his remarkable
system of philosophy, used the brains
of all the men who had preceded him in
the difficult work of solving the problems
of existence. Darwin saw much in nature,
because, through relation, he was able to
look through the eyes of all naturalists.</p>

<p>All values, whether in soil, waterfalls,
precious stones, or money, are forms of
social force. Land in a great city sells for
two thousand dollars a front foot, because
millions of people, drawn by the powers
of commerce, have come into fellowship
upon it. Robinson Crusoe would have
given all the money he had on the ship<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_51"></a>[51]</span>
for a loaf of bread. The heaps of gold
and silver in Wall Street are so valuable,
because seventy millions of people are
circulating around them.</p>

<p>Moral laws are social products. They
are not empirical, but fundamental, eternal,
and essential. They inhere in the constitution
of man. But it is only through
relation that man comes to the recognition
of them, as binding for conduct. Light
and heat have their laws, definite and unfailing,
but if natural particles never
vibrated at a rate sufficient to create these
forces, the laws would not appear. They
arise along with the forces, and the same
conditions which give rise to the forces,
give rise to the laws. So moral laws
accompany a certain degree of attainment
and culture, only possible through relation.</p>

<p>Religion itself, the highest and most
sacred deposit of human life, is a product<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_52"></a>[52]</span>
of social force. Whether we regard it as
“modes of emotion,” as Lecky; or the
“recognition of all our duties as divine
commands,” as Kant; or as “awe in the
presence of the mystery of an inscrutable
power in the universe,” as Spencer; or as
“the infinite nature of duty,” as Mill; or
as “the immediate feeling of the dependence
of man on God,” as Schleiermacher,
it never arises outside the range of relation.
Still, religion is something constitutional,
inalienable, divine; but man would
never be thrilled by its hopes, or soothed
by its peace, did he not stand in vital relation
to his fellows. The elements and raw
material of religion are eternally present,
but relation calls into exercise the susceptibilities
and faculties which appropriate
these elements and raw material, turning
them into hymns, theologies, prayers, sacrifices,
liturgies, and ceremonies.</p>

<p>Commerce, by bringing men together<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_53"></a>[53]</span>
under the necessities of finding food, clothing,
shelter, enables them to find their intellects
and what they can know, their
hearts and what they can love, and their
wills and what they can do.</p>

<p>Thus we trace the genesis of social force,
with the expressions which it makes of
itself, in property, literature, law, art, and
religion, to mutual human relations, for
the establishment of which, among men,
Commerce seems to have been ordained.
If men could, without trading, have found
the means of subsistence, as do the foxes
and the lions; then no relations in the high
sense of the term would have been established
among them; and like the foxes and
the lions, they would have remained on
the earth without progress and without
history.</p>

<p>The sun must be making tremendous
drafts upon some unseen sources of power,
to be able to make, throughout the solar<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_54"></a>[54]</span>
realm, such ample expenditures of energy
without bankruptcy.</p>

<p>The location of the vast depositories of
power, upon which he draws so liberally,
we are not to inquire here. We do know
that the force which builds the forest,
flushes the meadows with green, braids the
vines into festoons, and peoples the plant-world,
comes from the sun. Wherever the
materials which keep the sun’s fires burning
come from, they must pass up to that
center before they are available for service
on this globe. The stamp and superscription
of the sun must be upon them before
they can take the form of grass, or leaf, or
bird on the earth. In this sense stand
human relations between the force contained
in the individual, unrelated life, and
the force which takes form in the objects
of civilization. The crude and inarticulate
force in the individuals of the tribe, or the
nomads who only touch for war or passion,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_55"></a>[55]</span>
must be refined through moral, political,
and spiritual relations before it is ready to
take the form of poem, anthem, temple, or
Plato.</p>

<h3>II.</h3>

<p>We wish to determine the principle in
accordance with which the production and
distribution of food, shelter, and clothing
are to be regulated. These forms of value
are embodiments of social energy, generated
through relations formed above nature
by intelligence and volition. In nature,
then, we are not to find the law that is to
regulate them.</p>

<p>Bees build their cells, and birds their nests,
and beavers their dams, not by intelligence
and will, called into existence after birth
through companionship, but by what is in-wrought
into the very fibers of their being
irrespective of companionship. Birds, bees,
and beavers have been in the world<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_56"></a>[56]</span>
thousands of years, yet the first bird, bee,
or beaver ever created had as much sense
as the last. A single bee has as much sense
as all the bees in the world put together.
Among all lower animals each individual
inherits the sense of the species. Hence
the law “of the struggle for existence,” resulting
in “the survival of the fittest,” said
to be a regulating principle in the plant
and animal kingdoms, is not severe, regarded
with reference to the individuals
which inhabit them. But to regard the
operations of this law as beneficent upon
the plane of human life, as does Mr. Spencer,
is altogether to overlook the obligations
men are under to one another, because
of their mutual relations. The life of
each man, it must be remembered, in so far
as it is above that of the unrelated savage,
is contained in the life of every other man.
In so far as it is comfortable, intelligent,
and free, it has been brought to him, and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_57"></a>[57]</span>
made over to him by his fellow-man. The
law which is to determine the regulation of
the elements of commerce, which are but
expressions of the energy arising through
mutual human relations, must be as elevated
as the relations which commerce begets,
and which in turn make commerce
possible.</p>

<p>We must not go down among the tigers
and the hyenas, who owe nothing but bare
birth to companionship, where the principle
of “the survival of the fittest in the
struggle for existence” does prevail, to get
the law which is to regulate the production
and distribution of products possible only
through companionship. Each individual,
be he weak or strong, has contributed
something to the social body. The strength
of the one may have contributed courage,
the weakness of the other may have called
forth pity; but both pity and courage are
virtues possible only in relation. A regulating<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_58"></a>[58]</span>
principle that kills off the feeble
ones, and drives the weak ones to the wall,
may do for brutes, who owe nothing to relationships;
but not for men, who owe
everything to them. The attempt to regulate
forms of value in accordance with the
law of “the survival of the fittest in the
struggle for existence” does not have sufficient
regard for the contribution each individual
has made, by the very fact of his
existence, to make these values possible.
The leading political economists of the
times have come to see that the law of
extreme individualism, of “every man for
himself and the devil take the hindmost,”
must be substituted by some more beneficent
principle—by some law that pays
more respect to the methods by which
values have been created.</p>

<p>The province of commerce, as an institution,
is to bring men together, not merely
that the boundaries of commerce may be<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_59"></a>[59]</span>
extended and its volume increased, but that
men may learn the mutual obligations they
are under to one another, that their sympathy
for one another may be enlarged,
and that respect for one another may be
engendered.</p>

<p>It is only in an atmosphere of mutual
trust, sympathy, and respect that men can
grow.</p>

<p>The need for bread, for protection, for
raiment, prompts men to the exchange of
products, that each may share into the work
of all. But in the process of exchanging
products, relations are established, through
the influence and power of which an order
of man comes the mere material comforts
of life cannot supply. The significance of
commerce, then, is not understood, if it is
considered simply with reference to its
immediate ends. These ends are met when
men are supplied with the material comforts
of life. Ends, however, are mediated<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_60"></a>[60]</span>
through it of a kind different in order and
degree. These we consider the essential
and ultimate ends of the relations which
are established through the exchange of
products. What, then, is the ultimate end
and object of human relations? It is man.
Man come to himself, conscious of himself,
in possession of himself. It is human life,
enriched, perfected, completed. It is man,
strong, free, holy. It is man, not lost in the
social texture, nor swamped in the social
organism; but, finding his individuality
and his peculiar, natural, simple self
through them. The marvelous fabric the
social loom was set to weaving is man.
The highest end of social relations is a self-conscious,
self-determining man, thinking
the true, willing the right, loving the good.
These relations constitute the organism out
of which alone he can be born into symmetrical,
well rounded life.</p>

<p>The lower animals come from natural<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_61"></a>[61]</span>
birth into the world entire and complete.
The young eaglet is correlated to the sky
before he leaves the egg. But man moves
on a plane lower than the brutes, if he is
not caught at birth and carried by relation
to his proper place. As man is the highest
product of social relations, it follows that
the highest product is the ultimate product.</p>

<p>An apple tree may be used for fire wood,
or sawn into planks, but apples are the ultimate
reasons for the existence of the apple
tree. Toward an apple the germ started
when it burst the sod and stood a little
sprig above the ground. Beyond the
apple, the tree goes no further. It throws
its roots into the earth and its branches
into the atmosphere, and perpetually acts
and reacts upon its environment, but all
for the purpose of turning soil, and sunshine,
and rain into apples.</p>

<p>As we have seen, a part of the social
energy arising through mutual human relations<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_62"></a>[62]</span>
is to be converted into language,
values, literature, morality, and religion, as
a part of the capital invested in a sewing
machine factory goes into tools. But man
is greater than language, values, literature,
morality, or religion; as the sewing machine
is greater than the tools by which it is
made. Human relations create language,
values, art, morality, and religion, that they
may be used to advance and perfect the
main work they were ordained to perform,
“the making of a man.”</p>

<p>When the people of a nation come to regard
the elements of wealth, literature, art,
or even religion, as ends to be enjoyed
rather than as means to make man, they
have missed the purpose of creation, and
wander amid the mazes of stupidity and
blindness.</p>

<p>As far as outward splendor and wealth
were concerned, Babylon had no rival
among the nations of ancient times. She<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_63"></a>[63]</span>
was a vast and rich empire. She embraced
the most fertile portion of the
globe. She had a capital that eclipsed all
others in magnificence. Her hanging gardens
were the wonder of the world; but
her people stood not upon their terraces to
observe the stars, or to reach a higher civilization
through the realization of the
nobler ends of their being. These were
used as places of revelry and sensual enjoyment.
Thus the only work of art that
made them famous was used to make them
stupid and depraved. Of her wealth she
made an end. Putting no estimate upon
men, through the relations of whom her
wealth was created, she found at last that
among all her people she had produced no
man amply endowed enough to give permanent
mental setting to her civilization
and her faith. Her heart throbs, whatever
they were, got explained in no history, interpreted
in no philosophy, and lived in no<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_64"></a>[64]</span>
life. For knowledge of her, we are dependent
upon her ruins, her pottery, her
broken columns. Into oblivion has fallen
all that bejeweled and pampered life that
reveled in her palaces and amid her far-famed
hanging gardens. Among none of
her luxurious inhabitants did she develop
a man to commit the keeping of her
secrets and the record of her progress.
Over her history has settled the stillness
of the desert and the gloom of eternal
night.</p>

<p>On the other hand, how secure is the
Greece, that flowered in her great men! It
was in the two centuries between 500 and
300 <span class="allsmcap">B. C.</span>, when she emphasized men more
than the things they created, that she produced
the men who have been the teachers
of the human race. She has been despoiled
of her art treasures, her temples
have fallen, her Parthenon is in ruins; but
the two hundred years of her life, which<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_65"></a>[65]</span>
she deposited in her great men, are immortal.</p>

<p>No tooth of time, no war’s bloody hand,
no devastation of the years, can take from
her the glory which she lifted and locked
in the genius of her generals, her statesmen,
her orators, and her philosophers. Epaminondas
and Pericles still fight for her, and
guard with sleepless vigilance her fair
name. Plato and Aristotle still interpret
her problems of destiny. Sophocles and
Pindar still sing her glory. Herodotus and
Thucydides still keep the record of her
victories. Demosthenes and Æschines still
give imperishable expression to her conceptions
of form and symmetry. She deposited
her riches in the spirits of her
great men, and they are forever secure. No
thief can steal them, no rust can corrupt
them. The unfolding centuries may look
in upon them and enjoy them, but they
cannot arrest them. The spirits of great<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_66"></a>[66]</span>
men, like immortal ships, sail the ocean of
time, bearing the treasures of the civilizations
which gave them birth. They outride
the fury of all the storms, and will
sail on, till</p>

<p>But when Greece came to think more of
the results than of the living men, she lost
not only the power to produce the men,
but the capacity to appreciate the results
which had been created by them. Thinking
more of the temple than the builder,
she soon had no architect to conceive,
and no son to understand the temple.
Turning her national power into the
spirits of her living men, she utilized the
mountains and the mines in the service of
beauty. But when life got cheaper than
art, she no longer had power to create new
art, or to protect from vandalism the old.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_67"></a>[67]</span>
By removing the emphasis from men to
things, she descended from the Crœsus to
the pauper of civilization.</p>

<p>As long as Israel expended her national
energy in the production of men, she had
Moses, greater than the Tabernacle;
David, greater than his harp; and Isaiah,
greater than his song. But when the
forms of her worship were emphasized
beyond the spirits of her people she lost
the devotion which created her church and
the manhood that guided it. The men
who formulated the laws that made Rome
the mistress of the world, grew at a period
when a Roman was the center of interest
in the empire. But when her laws were
stressed to the obliteration of her men, she
had them still, without the ability to make
more laws, or to execute the ones she had.
Religion in India is emphasized more than
character; hence her men are lost in a
wanton and luxurious surrender to a modeless,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_68"></a>[68]</span>
transcendental, pure being, and she is
practically without a history.</p>

<h3>III.</h3>

<p>The ultimate reasons, then, for the existence
of social relations, brought about
among human beings by exchange of products,
is not the satisfaction of hunger, or
the enrichment of individuals in material
wealth, but the making of men. This being
so, we are able to determine the law
by which the production and distribution
of commercial products are to be regulated.
It must be a law that does not put the
emphasis on the products, but upon the
men who are to be elevated through their
exchange. It must not be a law leaning
to extreme individualism on the one side,
or to extreme socialism on the other. It
must have proper respect to the individual,
and to the social organism to which he is
indebted for whatever of power he possesses.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_69"></a>[69]</span>
That law has already been formulated
for us. It is this: “Thou shalt love
thy neighbor as thyself.” This is the coordination
of self-love and good-will. As
has been well said, this saves for us the
strength of private enterprise, and individual
initiative, the vigor of the self-regarding
motives; yet enthrones by their side as co-equal
and co-regent powers, the principle of
benevolence, the obligation to promote the
common weal. Self-support, self-help, self-reliance,
are still cardinal virtues, but philanthropy
is given co-ordinate authority
with them in the commercial world. This
is the law most favorable to the growth of
men.</p>

<p>Under its benign reign, men can come
to themselves. Through the operation of
this law, there will be no curtailment of
the volume or the extent of commerce;
but the emphasis will be kept in the right
place, and men will not be lost in the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_70"></a>[70]</span>
process of securing the elements of food
and shelter. Commerce will be the means
of mediating to men their higher nature.
Surrounded by conditions engendered by
the operation of a law like this, life will
reach through relation higher and higher
ranges of hope and insight. The elements
of poems, symphonies, philosophies, temples,
and pictures will flow in the blood.</p>

<p>The fierce competition we see in the
commercial world to-day is the attempt to
re-enact, in business life, the principle of
natural selection, or “the survival of the
fittest in the struggle for existence.” This
is the law of the jungle, but not of the
social realm. This is doubtless the law
among trees, determining their number,
variety, and structure; for one tree gains
nothing from association with other trees.
This law doubtless operates in the sea,
among the fish, and in the sky among the
birds, for fish and birds are what they are<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_71"></a>[71]</span>
by birth and not by association. Mr.
Spencer regards the operation of this law
as beneficent. It kills off the unsuccessful
members of society, it drives the weak
ones to the wall. Those who survive in the
struggle are the fittest. The Greeks, who
put Socrates to death, were, according to this
so-called beneficent principle, the fittest to
survive. This law is regarded as beneficent
as it operates among men to control their
products, upon the supposition that man is
an animal and a part and parcel of nature, as
are the bears and the wolves. The things
which elevate men and civilize them, however,
do not come from nature, but are
engendered through companionship and
association. Hence, from the sense of
obligation men are under to one another
for the best and highest things of life, the
law is to be deduced which is to regulate
their commerce and to determine the
character of their actions. This law is,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_72"></a>[72]</span>
“Thou shalt love thy neighbor as thyself.”
Thus business looks to character. The
discipline it insures is worth more than
the money it brings. The highest product
of trade is man himself. If in business
such methods are practiced, if such aims
are followed as destroy the man, however
great the returns in money, it is a thousand
fold worse than a failure. The
man it was designed to make, it has
destroyed.</p>

<h3>IV.</h3>

<p>The disposition to accumulate, which
is right and praiseworthy, should always
be modified by right knowledge of the
uses of property, and the methods by
which it is amassed. Nothing is more
pitiable than for a person to have more
property than he has manhood. This
indicates that the stress has been on the
wrong side of the wealth. Such a man is<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_73"></a>[73]</span>
under the sad necessity of taking his significance
from the money he has accumulated,
rather than the noble elements of
life he should have secured in the process
of obtaining it. With such a man,
the end of business has been lost. He has
consumed the end in the means. Instead
of turning the elements of trade into
manhood, manhood has been lost amid
the maze and chaos of things. The order
of progress has been violated, and the
man, instead of moving on through business
cares to immortal character, turns
back to the earth, and seeks to substitute
the tendency to move from it, by the disposition
to settle permanently upon it.
The desire to get rich has grown so abnormal
and perverted, that it seeks to
satisfy itself by the abundance of mere
things. There are a great number of
mowers and reapers, engines and cotton-gins,
hats and shoes, pins and buttons;<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_74"></a>[74]</span>
but a man has been lost in the making
of them. This is more than all the
mowers and reapers, cotton-gins and
steam engines, pins and buttons ever
made are worth. It is not mete that
men should be sacrificed to the beauty
and perfection of machinery, or to things
machinery turns out. It is not necessary
either. What we gain is not worth what we
give. The machinery should be so manipulated
as to get the things, and at the
same time secure the perfection of men
through the process. It is not necessary
for the painter to lose himself in his art,
and sacrifice his manhood to make his
vision glow on the canvas. A proper
regard for the methods and uses of art
will result in leaving in the living spirit
a picture more perfect than any painted
by the brush. John Bunyan did not lose
his manhood in portraying the history
of a human soul in its attempts to get<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_75"></a>[75]</span>
from earth to heaven. While conducting
his pilgrim safely through the sorrow and
temptations of life, to a home in a better
world, he opened the pearly gates to his
own soul. His work transfigured his
life, and was the means of sanctifying it.
All business and all work should lift up,
and not hold down; it should make free,
and not enslave; it should ennoble and not
degrade. It is as honorable to make shoes
or anchors as to paint pictures or write
books. The shoemaker should learn the
secret through his work of finding the
sandals of manhood for his own feet.
The blacksmith should learn, through the
making of anchors for the great ships, to
find the anchor that is to hold his own
soul to the truth, amid the storms of life.</p>

<h3>V.</h3>

<p>If through trade only the material result
is sought, the ends it were intended to subserve<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_76"></a>[76]</span>
are missed. Its bulk may be large,
the machinery through which it is carried
on manifold and complicated, but with the
emphasis on the money side of it, no manhood
will be reached through it. The man
side of a button machine is infinitely more
important than the button side. The buttons
which fall on one side may conform
precisely to an approved and an exquisite
pattern, but if the person who stands on
the other side does not, through the process
of making buttons, get a man out of
himself, the whole thing is a disastrous
failure. Human spirits are too valuable to
be used up in making buttons. More respect
is to be had to the human side of the
loom than to the cloth side. The most
beautiful pattern of silk ever woven loses
its power to please the eye when it is remembered
that the soul of a woman has
been drawn into its threads and colors.
The sacrifice of individual life is impressive<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_77"></a>[77]</span>
and noble, if the object for which it is
made is worthy. This kind of sacrifice is
not the means of losing life, but of gaining
it. But no material result to be used up
in the passing season of fashion is worth
such costly sacrifice.</p>

<p>Through forces we name capillarity, cohesion,
and gravitation, matter accomplishes
the purposes of thought. They are but
manifestations of the power of mind working
through them, to build up the mineral,
vegetable, and animal kingdoms. They look
beyond themselves. They work for higher
ends. Thus all the industries we see in
nature look to lifting and refining matter,
and force high enough to serve the uses of
human life. So the industries established
on the plane of human life are to elevate
man another step in the scale of being.
Through sowing and reaping, through
grinding and sawing, through spinning
and weaving, through buying and selling,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_78"></a>[78]</span>
through building and furnishing, he is to
be carried on in the march of progress.</p>

<p>The history of the physical universe culminates
in man, finds its interpreter and
its interpretation in him. Never was the
thought of him absent from her movements
through Pliocene, Miocene, Eocene, Cretaceous,
Jurassic, Triassic, Carboniferous, Devonian,
Silurian, or Cambrian ages. In all
her awful cosmic emotion to reach order
and form, it was the anticipation of man
that moved her, for he it is at last that
comes of it. So, through all the course of
her tumultuous history, nature was pregnant
with man. The stars which sang together
in the early morning of the world,
caught the inspiration which gave melody
to their song from the thought of him.</p>

<p>Commerce, if it is to be permanent and
healthy and progressive, must fall into line
with the purpose nature was put upon its
perilous course to subserve. Her countless<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_79"></a>[79]</span>
forms of industry established by the law
of supply and demand; her cars, rushing
hither and thither all round the world; her
great steamships on every sea; her great
furnaces, whose chimneys lift themselves
against the sky, must get their meaning
and the reason for their existence from the
fact that they are putting in their contribution
to the making of a man. Her
wheels are to fly, her spindles are to whirl,
her paddles are to splash, and her hammers
are to ring, making music amid it all, in
anticipation of his increasing worth, his
growing thought, his enlarging hope. Her
countless wheels of industry will be throwing
out axes, wagons, plow-stocks, hand-saws,
and reapers as they fly; but these will
be only so many means used to discipline
the precious life committed for a while to
her training. What chemical affinity did
in lifting the original elements to the
mineral kingdom, and what the animal<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_80"></a>[80]</span>
did to lift the plant to the animal kingdom,
so the trades and industries of commerce
are to do in lifting human life from
its individual, unrelated state to its social
and fraternal state. The elements of commerce
are to be the means to help human
character out of human nature. Two kinds
of raw material are to be refined. The iron
in the mountain is to be turned into razor
blades and caligraphs; the reeds in the
swamps and the woods in the forests are to
be turned into the notes of organ and piano;
and in the process of refining these, man is
to be disciplined in the use of himself, in
the possession of himself, and in the command
of himself.</p>

<span class="smaller">THE PROVISION FOR THE SOCIAL NATURE OF MAN.</span></h2>

</div>

<h3>I.</h3>

<p>Man has a body and a spirit. By the
one, he is individual; by the other, he is
social. As individual, he needs bread; as
social, he needs power. As body, he is born
from the loins; as spirit, he is born from
the social organism. In the process of finding
food, clothing, shelter, to meet the needs
of himself as individual, he discovers that
illimitable social side of himself the material
necessities of life do not supply.
Here he finds power, a more subtle and universal
element, ready to serve his higher
need. This is the provision for the social
side of man’s nature; for, as individual, he
does not need it, and could not appropriate<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_84"></a>[84]</span>
and use it if he did. As an individual, he
can only avail himself of the use of power,
through the attempt of the social whole of
which he forms a member. In the primitive,
unrelated, unorganized state, man is
satisfied if he can secure food to satisfy his
hunger, and a cave to shelter him from the
storm. He does not even utilize the winds
to draw his boat, until, through interdependence
and mutual relations, he has
reached a high degree of social life. The
servants of man, on his individual side, are
the foods of the field, the waters of the
spring, the woods of the forest, the fruits of
the orchard, and the wool on the sheep’s
back. The servants of man, on his social
side, are the driving power of the winds,
the transporting power of heat, and the
thought-defying power of the lightning.
As individual, he is a citizen of the community
where he first sees the light. As
social, he is a citizen of the world. Through<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_85"></a>[85]</span>
his body, he is naturally related to his ancestors;
through his spirit, he is related to
the human race. The rude elements of
food, clothing, and shelter, he might secure
as individual; but power, which waits to
serve his higher, nobler nature, he can only
secure through society. As individual, he
is narrow, meager, local. As social, he is
broad, rich, universal. On his individual
side, he is centripetal; on his social side, centrifugal.
Self-centered, self-contained, and
self-included, on the one side; while, upon
the other, he is possessed of the conviction
that private right must be subordinated to
public good. Tethered to the earth on the
one side, linked with the immensities on the
other. On the one side, his outlook is hard
and literal and low; on the other, he seeks,
through intellect, to transcend the infinite
in time and space and truth. On the side
of himself, as individual, he knows no right
or wrong. On the side of himself, as social,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_86"></a>[86]</span>
he recognizes the infinite in duty, and seeks
harmony through the infinite in love.</p>

<h3>II.</h3>

<p>Yet this limited and unlimited self; transitory,
perishable, and finite on the one side;
everlasting, imperishable, and infinite on
the other, are bound together in the same
person. The fall of the one is accompanied
by the descent of the other, and the rise
of the one is accompanied by the ascent of
the other. Their union involves perpetual
conflict, and there waits on the turn of the
battle, the depression of remorse, or the
exultation of triumph.</p>

<p>On the individual side of himself, man
would take up with the present, the immediate,
with that which allures the sense,
and, with unholy incense, regales the imagination.
On the social side of himself,
he would despise the immediate, and give
the casting vote in favor of the unbiased,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_87"></a>[87]</span>
immeasurable good. In such a being as
man, conflict were inevitable. With a
horizon measured by the edge of the plain
where he stands on the one side, and a horizon
melting into the infinite star depths on
the other, it were but to be expected that a
contest would arise between the larger
and the lesser outlook. On the one side,
he would possess the field, concentrate his
attention upon its grasses and its fruits,
and lose himself in its products. On the
other, he would go forth to see where the
stars are, to consider the sources of their
light, and to travel with them along their
silent paths. With a view measured by
the hour that shuts him round on the one
side, and with a view measured by the
organic pulsations of the world on the
other; the question would be, whether to
give himself to the immediate pleasures of
the hour; or to elongate the pendulum of
his timepiece till it should embrace the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_88"></a>[88]</span>
ages, and regulate his life by an eternal
measure. With appetites on one side,
clamoring for the things in sight, and with
conscience on the other, calling for harmony
with things high and remote; the
question would be, whether to give the
consent of the will to the demand of the
appetites, or to the appeal of the conscience.</p>

<h3>III.</h3>

<p>Knowing the side of himself of which a
man takes counsel—the individual, or the
social—you are prepared to fix his grade
in the scale of being. The difference between
Benedict Arnold and George Washington
was just this: in the case of the one
the individual side was dominant; in the
case of the other the social side held sway.
This is the difference between the miser,
despised of all, and the philanthropist,
honored of all. This is the difference between<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_89"></a>[89]</span>
the debauche and the saint, between
the man who lives for his God and his
race, and the man who pours himself out
on his lust and his passion. If the
promptings of the individual side of man’s
nature are to be distrusted and watched,
while liberal and unstinted recognition is
to be given to the social side, it is well to
inquire into the meaning and office of this
larger fact of his life.</p>

<p>Let it be granted that on the individual
side of himself man has no kingdom of his
own, no department of his own, no privileged
class of his own, and no titled order
of his own. Let this side of him be
left to the naturalist, to be classed
with the vertebrates, the mammals, or the
primates. But what conclusion are we to
reach concerning the social side of himself,
that has found embodiment in that vast
and complicated movement we call civilization?
Through this age-long historic process<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_90"></a>[90]</span>
man has been seeking to realize the
capacities of his larger nature. Like a
magnificent temple, civilization has been
rising through the centuries. Its walls
have silently come up from the earth, like
Solomon’s Temple, without clink of trowel
or sound of hammer. It is built of granite,
cut from the Gethsemanes of history.
Leonidas and his brave three hundred at
the pass of Thermopylæ carved some of
the blocks of this great edifice, into whose
walls men have gone down as the living
stones. The brave Britons, at the waters
of Solway, lifted to place some of the
richly foliaged pillars that stand upon its
floors. William the Silent, while organizing
the forces and achieving the victories
of the Netherlands, was at the same time
turning some of its arches and resting in
place some of its architraves. The
Martyrs, who went to undying fame and
honor through fires of Smithfield, furnish<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_91"></a>[91]</span>
themes for the music which resounds
through its corridors. It is the triumph
of the social nature of man, and stands
upon the soil which has been made by the
crumbling dust of all generations of brave
men. Its pinnacles and towers pierce the
skies, and declare to the immeasurable
heights, the force, the faith, the sentiment,
and the love of man. It defies the elements
of disintegration and change, and
around the tops of its lofty pillars there
cluster the buds of eternal spring. The
gigantic trunks, whose arched branches
support the roof of this great structure,
express themselves in never withering
flowers, and, where the boughs interlace at
the summit of the arches, there comes the
light of heaven to color and illumine.
Yet within its doors we are in no forest of
stone, where thoughts of men have been
chiseled into semblance with the trees.
Its foundations are built of convictions, its<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_92"></a>[92]</span>
pillars of hope, its vaulting of lofty purpose,
and its windows of faith. Its
cement is the blood of suffering, and its
decoration the loves of heroes. It is the
edifice man has built in which to house
the social side of his nature. It contains
and will conserve all contributions ever
made to human weal.</p>

<p>In walking the streets of Rome, one has
a strange and melancholy sense of the traditions
and memories which cluster about
every ruin and every spot. But around
the myriad facts and forces of civilization
there hang associations more pathetic still.
Here we walk, not amid the ruins of the
past, but amid the achievements, the victories,
and the glories of the past. Achievements,
victories, and glories not associated
with broken columns, defaced monuments
and moldering ruins, but with the laws
and institutions of living men. We have
here, in ten thousand embodied forms, the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_93"></a>[93]</span>
travails of the souls of our fathers. Their
spirits live in the words we use, their consciences
bind in the laws we observe, their
visions bless in the pictures we see, and
their devotion sanctifies in the religion we
love. All the blood ever shed in sacrifice,
all the eloquence that ever thrilled senates
and peoples in defense of the right, all the
protests ever in silence felt or in public uttered
against the wrong, are here held in
everlasting form.</p>

<p>Are we to regard civilization, the manifold
and complicated sum in which man’s
social nature has expressed itself, as nothing
more than a natural product? Are we
to account for this by the same physical
principles in accordance with which the bee
builds his cell, the monkey hangs his
bridge, and the beaver erects his dam?
Does this stately projection of man’s social
nature mean no more than some lofty Alpine
Matterhorn, pushed into the heavens<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_94"></a>[94]</span>
by the unconscious fires in the earth’s
bosom? Is this only like some mighty
Giants’ Causeway, lifted up by the same
physical forces and by the same natural
processes? If this is so, why is it that when
we turn away from civilization as a whole,
to view it in some of its national forms, we
see the spiritual ups and downs of history
in such striking contrast with the uniform
face which nature wears? If the radiant
civilization of Greece, that filled the earth
with the eloquence of thought and the
melody of song, with the Republic of Plato
and the Ethics of Aristotle, that clothed
itself in the Parthenon of Phidias and the
Iliad of Homer, was as natural among the
nations as the uprising of Gibraltar among
the mountains, why is it that Gibraltar still
stands as the solemn sentinel of the Ocean
and the Sea, while the civilization of
Greece is but a memory of the past? The
same sky and earth, and Mar’s Hill are<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_95"></a>[95]</span>
there. Around her classic coast there still
murmurs the same heaving sea. But while
ships may still sail to Gibraltar, never more
can they draw up to the Piræus of worthy
representatives of Plato and Aristotle.
Not again do men, with noble brows, deep
eyes, and never dying thought, look into
the Ægean from that memorable meeting
place of the world’s ships.</p>

<p>If the history of Israel, from the time of
Abraham to the coming of John the Baptist,
was but a natural product, as easy to
be accounted for as the mountains round
about Jerusalem; why is it that the mountains
still encompass the holy city; while
we find no more men like Moses, David,
and Isaiah to lead, to rule, and to prophesy?
There are the same Judean hills and valleys.
There rapidly flows the same historic
Jordan. There grow the same grapes,
the figs, and olives. There are the same
holy mountains. There are the same dangerous<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_96"></a>[96]</span>
rocks in the sea at Joppa. The physical
conditions that made the corn and the
honey and the cattle are there; and there
still are found the corn, the honey, and the
cattle. But no massive man like Moses
ever more climbs Sinai to get law on tables
of stone, or Pisgah, to see the promised
land and die. No man after God’s own
heart, like David, any more minds sheep,
watches the stars, and writes poetry there.
Never more do we find there a man like
Isaiah, struggling on his knees in prayer
that he may rise up to give his people the
oracles of God. A shallow, degenerate
and fickle people dwell amid the groves
and the vines where once lived the great
race which gave to men their ethics and
the outlines of true religion.</p>

<p>If the civilization of Rome, that reached
such volume and force as to make her the
mistress of the world, was as natural as
the rising and falling of the tides, why is it<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_97"></a>[97]</span>
that Rome is in ruins, while the tides continue
to rise and fall? With no other aid
than such as is afforded by natural law
and physical force, we cannot solve this
problem. Where monkeys grew once,
monkeys grow to-day; where lions roamed
once, lions roam to-day; where figs grew
once, figs grow to-day. The same physical
conditions, the same configuration of soil,
the same degree of climate, produce uniform
natural results from age to age.
These may be counted on with the certainty
of a coming eclipse, conditioned on
varying conjunctions of the heavenly
bodies. But we must pass from the level
and range of soil, sky, climate, and physical
conditions, to account for the fact that a
country in one period of its history produces
a Pericles, and, in another, a
muddy-headed numskull; in one age an
aristocracy of poets, artists, statesmen,
philosophers, and orators; and in another,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_98"></a>[98]</span>
a listless swarm of stupid and secular cumberers
of the ground.</p>

<h3>IV.</h3>

<p>The explanation of this question is to be
found in the fact that man has a dual nature,
a body and a spirit, by virtue of which
he is individual and social. When the
center of gravity is on the social side of
human nature, the fortunes of man go up;
when the center of gravity is on the individual
side, the fortunes of man go down.
On the individual side, he is the subject of
physical law. On the social side, of moral
law.</p>

<p>That man was intended to express the
force of his life through the social side of
himself and in accordance with moral law,
instead of through the individual side of
himself and in accordance with physical
law, is plain, from the fact that it is only
when he gives social expression to his life<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_99"></a>[99]</span>
that he reaches any degree of commanding
and permanent influence.</p>

<p>The unrivaled place which the Greece
of Pericles holds in history is due to the
fact that he lived at a time when the
emphasis was altogether on the social side
of her people. The individual side was
completely subordinated to the life of the
whole. It is doubtless true that she
pressed a right to rule too far, and stressed
the citizen too much, and considered the
claims of the individual too little. A
proper balance is to be preserved between
the individual and the social man. But it
is true that in merging the life of the individual
into that of the state, Greece did
prepare a soil compact and rich enough to
grow the most ample harvest of literature,
art, poetry, philosophy, and men, the world
ever saw. As soon as the emphasis passed
over from the social to the individual side,
the process of pulverization began, and the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_100"></a>[100]</span>
continuities of thought and aspiration
were broken up. National unity was
dissolved, and the conditions of great men
and great results were no longer present.</p>

<p>The difference between the Greece of
300 <span class="allsmcap">B. C.</span> and the Greece of to-day, is the
difference between giving the national life
a social and an individual expression.
The Greece of 300 <span class="allsmcap">B. C.</span> was a compact
whole, made so by each man putting in
his individual life as a contribution to the
life of the state. The Greece of to-day is
an aggregate of self-centered units, held
together like so many potatoes in a basket,
by outward force and barriers, rather than
by loyalty, patriotism, fidelity, and the
cling of man to man. In the Greece of
300 <span class="allsmcap">B. C.</span> each man, while giving his individual
life to his fellows, gathered into
his own being all the life they had to give.
Hence in Socrates we had a reproduction
of all Greece. In Homer, all her poetic<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_101"></a>[101]</span>
passion, and expression. In the orations of
Demosthenes, all the aspirations of her
heart and all her love of liberty. In the
Greece of to-day, we have not the same
intimacy of companionship, or the same
network of relationships. Each man,
thinking more of himself as individual
than of himself as social, finds it no longer
possible to make levies on the lives of his
fellows, to think his thought, conceive his
temple, deliver his oration, or write his
poem. So it follows, they no longer think
great thoughts, conceive great temples,
deliver great orations, or write great
poems. Each man, in the high sense,
being a separate sand, they have a social
soil as barren as a desert.</p>

<p>Rome won her victories, wrote her laws,
and laid the foundations of her world-wide
empire, when her people gave social rather
than individual expression to the force
of their lives. A typical illustration we<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_102"></a>[102]</span>
have of this in the fidelity of Regulus.
A prisoner at Carthage, he is permitted to
go to Rome to induce his countrymen to
make peace with the Carthaginians. He
pledged his word to return if he failed.
On reaching Rome, however, instead of
seeking to persuade his people to make
peace, he appealed to them to continue
the war. The social side of himself belonged
to Rome; speaking through that,
he called upon her to prosecute the war.
The individual side of himself was personal;
acting through that, he went back
to Carthage in honor of his pledge, to be
cruelly put to death by his captors. This
single incident is sufficient to help us
understand why, from her seven hills,
Rome conquered and for a long time ruled
the world. The individual was sunk in
the <i>Roman</i>. Not, as in the case of Greece,
that his personal identity might be swallowed
up in the mass, but that he might<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_103"></a>[103]</span>
find a personal identity as great as the
empire, of whose social life he was the
embodiment. Regulus was an epitome of
Rome. In him was all her indomitable
will, her moral sturdiness, her iron probity.
In him she had a son, in the depth
of whose spirit all the glory she had won
in war, and all the control she had found
in sacrifice, was safe. Regulus had the
advantage of the Carthaginians, in that
the larger, nobler side of himself was safe
from their hate. The Roman, the social
Regulus, was as eternal as the majesty,
and fame, and mystery of the Roman
empire.</p>

<p>The doom of Rome, as a nation, was
never sealed till the stress was removed
from the social to the individual side of her
people. She might have lived on among
the nations, as fixed as her own eternal hills,
if the temptations to self-indulgence and
self-gratification had been resisted. Her<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_104"></a>[104]</span>
downfall was not due to physical causes,
but to her sins. Observance of the moral
laws, which made her great, would have
kept her great. When she threw her
larger, social self into the fires of her individual
lust and passion, she burned the
foundations of her dominion, and a mighty
wreck of shapeless ruins was all that was
left of the once proud mistress of the
world.</p>

<h3>V.</h3>

<p>What is the correlate to the social side
of man’s nature? Where is the domain
that matches it? Where is the vast realm,
large enough to furnish sufficient scope for
all the possibilities which seem to lie folded
within it? A study of the eye reveals the
fact that the light of the sun is necessary
to furnish an element wide and ethereal
enough for the exercise of its functions.
By a study of the ear, we learn
that it is related to sound with all its possibilities<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_105"></a>[105]</span>
of harmony. The fin of the fish
is related to the waters of the sea. The
bird’s wing is a prophecy of the sky. The
migrating instinct of the wild goose is related
to the South, with its soft skies and
balmy air.</p>

<p>In the calculations of Adams, in England,
and of Leverrier, in France, the perturbations
of the planet Uranus were
in correspondence with the planet Neptune.</p>

<p>On the side of himself as individual, as
we have seen, man is related to the earth
with all it contains to satisfy the needs of
the body. We wish also to determine the
nature and dimensions of the sphere to
which he is related as social.</p>

<p>We have seen that, even within national
boundaries, human life comes to be fertile
in great men, great deeds, and great art,
when the expression of it is social, rather
than individual. With such disposition of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_106"></a>[106]</span>
her national life force, Greece reached an
unparalleled height of grandeur and influence.
But all outside of Greece were
esteemed as barbarians. The barbarian
hordes around her state were like so many
walls, which kept the waves of national
life from passing out into any world-wide
sea. The limits were soon reached, then
the waves receded, to be thrown back
again in quick succession against the encompassing
walls. Was this not in violation
of the law and nature of the expression
which the social side of man, by its very
structure, is inclined to give of itself? Is
it not, by its nature, disposed to pass out in
accordance with moral laws, which have no
boundaries and limits? And were not the
walls they permitted their hate to build of
the barbarians on the outside to arrest the
outward flow of their national life, the evidence
of a tacit treaty with their selfishness?
Did these not, after all, bear witness<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_107"></a>[107]</span>
to a hampered and halted surrender to the
nobler side of their nature? Did they not
show that the Greeks were only willing to
give social expression to their national life,
as far as the boundary lines of Achai? Too
noble to permit the emphasis to rest on the
individual side of her people, as separate
members of the state, she lifted narrowness
and selfishness into greater place by giving
them national form.</p>

<p>Too great of breadth to be individually
selfish, she was not great enough to be
nationally unselfish. The individual sides
of themselves her people sacrificed on the
altars of the state to her national unity,
she transmuted into contempt and hatred
of other nations. Selfishness only passed
from the individual to the state. Retained
by the state, it worked itself back into the
individuals again, when the unity of the
state was disintegrated. Do we not have
in the limitations which Greece attempted<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_108"></a>[108]</span>
to put on the expression which the social
nature of man would give of itself, the real
secret of their downfall? If, while giving
even limited social expression to her
national life, Greece developed a civilization
so rich, how much greater might have been
her contribution to human progress had not
the seeds of disintegration been sown among
her people through national enmity and
hate. In the two hundred years which
embraced the most fertile portion of her
history she laid the foundation of thought.
But it was only through thought that she
sought to solve the problems of life and
destiny.</p>

<p>The social life of the Jews found only
limited expression for itself. It was worked
out into religious lines that were unlimited
and all embracing, but this was in spite of
their prejudices.</p>

<p>Their compact social life, the vast depth
and vigor of their social vitality, the tenacity<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_109"></a>[109]</span>
with which they clung together, made it
possible for them to lay the foundation of
a religion and an ethics larger than they
dreamed. Their scriptures, their prophets,
and their saints were not possible in a soil
less socially rich.</p>

<p>Their devotion, their loyalty, their
voluntary subordination of private to public
interests, their religious fidelity fitted them
to become the children of God. The summit
of civilization they reached enabled
them to see and to transcribe the outlines
of the kingdom of heaven. They ascended
high enough the mount of being to recognize
the laws necessary to regulate human
conduct. But they permitted their narrowness
and prejudice to build of the Gentiles
about them, walls to limit the outflow of
their national life. Hate for the unfortunate
people without, could not be without its
influence on the lives of those within.</p>

<p>The selfishness which, as a nation, they<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_110"></a>[110]</span>
cherished toward other people, reproduced
itself at length in their own lives. From
the children of God they descended until
they became the children of the devil.
The visions of their nobler men were
discounted and despised. The selfishness
that put them against the Gentiles, finally
put them against one another; and while
they kept together in a certain sense, in
spite of the upper and nether mill stones
of history, it was rather in memory of what
they had been, than of what they were.</p>

<p>In the civilization of Rome, again, limitations
were put on the expression of the
social side of man’s nature. Within the
precincts of Rome, under her eagles and
within her roads, there was a sinking of
the individual and an expression of the social
side, that has been rarely equaled in
history. It was this merging of the individual
units into the social whole of Rome,
that made it possible for her to formulate<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_111"></a>[111]</span>
the legal measures and provisions which continue
to protect human life and property.
But sacrifice, companionship, social cohesion
on the inside, could not, for many centuries,
be accompanied with fierce opposition and
cruel hate for others on the outside. It
was inevitable that sooner or later the disposition
on the outside would get distributed
among the individuals on the inside.</p>

<h3>VI.</h3>

<p>The realm, then, to which man on the
social side of himself is related, is larger
than that encompassed by any national
boundaries. The Greek, on the social side
of himself, was larger than Achai, the Jew
than Palestine, and the Roman than the
Empire. The Greek developed thought,
the Jew produced religion, and the Roman
formulated law. But the larger side of
man’s nature is not met by thought simply,
or by religion simply, or by law simply,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_112"></a>[112]</span>
but by the combination of these in right
proportions.</p>

<p>Man, on the social side of himself, is correlated
through reciprocal relations to the
human race. To limit the social expression
of man’s life is to contract its nature,
and to violate the moral laws in accordance
with which it must act. The understanding
cannot rest in unrelated phenomena.
Through science it reduces the
forces of nature to one force, its energies to
one energy, and its matter to its constituent
elements. So the social nature must find
harmony in the union and cohesion of scattered,
separated human beings. It must
have companionship, such as the relations
of all men help to make. It must have a
range as wide as the world. Because of
the continuities of life and thought secured
through universal social cohesion, it must
be able to pass and repass through the
length and breadth of human life. If<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_113"></a>[113]</span>
man’s social nature is to find its correlate,
the race must be so completely one, so
compact and contiguous in the spirit of
fraternity and good will, as to make it
possible for each man to share in the
work, thought, and virtue of all men. Individuals
must be gathered into the network
of social relations, so that, instead of
separate and isolated units, they shall be
known as farmers, merchants, blacksmiths,
mechanics, shoemakers, lawyers, doctors,
editors, and ministers. The calling of each
must relate to the well-being of all. Every
man must make for others and receive in
return for the supply of his own wants
something of all the others make. Into
the multiplex flow of exchanges the shoemaker
may put in simply one pair of shoes
per day, as his personal contribution. To
that extent he must be able to make levies
on the contributions of all the rest. No
one will be independent in an unrelated<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_114"></a>[114]</span>
sense. All will be dependent, and each
independent, through dependence on the
rest. The race, as civil society, will be at
work under all climes, and on all soils, producing
the infinite variety of goods for the
world’s market. By the specialization and
division of labor, we will have great increase
of skill and the multiplication of all
products. People will be at work raising
coffee and drugs in Brazil, tea in China,
creating a myriad of manufactures in England,
France, and Germany, growing fruits
on the Mediterranean Islands; these then
will be gathered by various means of transportation
and loaded on ships and cars, to
be carried to every place on earth; that
everyone may have the whole earth to
serve him, while on his part he renders
service to all.</p>

<h3>VII.</h3>

<p>The universal organization of the human
race into one social whole has been the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_115"></a>[115]</span>
grand, far-off event, toward which the
whole creation and the whole process of
history has moved. Toward this the race
has been moving through all the fierce antagonisms
and bloody wars of the past.</p>

<p>Pestilences, which have decimated the
ranks of men, and earthquakes, which have
swallowed up great cities, have contributed
toward this consummation.</p>

<p>The genius of men like Alexander the
Great has been used to break up the narrow
and provincial groupings into which
men had settled, that a way might be
opened for the distribution of products
and the circulation of ideas.</p>

<p>In the early history of the race, the
process of organization began. Every
great man and every great movement
helped toward its enlargement. Abraham,
getting up from Ur of the Chaldees, and
moving with his family and his herds across
the plains of Syria, to plant a government<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_116"></a>[116]</span>
in Palestine, widened its sphere. Phœnicia,
the strongest maritime power of ancient
times, while she had no motive but gain for
crowding every port with her ships, and
for turning the world into an exchange,
did augment the knowledge of men and increase
the relations of men. The Jews, by
their compact, social organization, lifted
their national life into a great civilization.
This civilization they sought to make provincial;
they sought to fence themselves
off, with all they had accumulated of devotion
and law and literature, from the rest
of mankind. But their social pulverization,
due to their sins, helped forward universal
companionship. They moved out
into other parts of the world. They settled
along the Black Sea and the Caspian
Sea. They went into Asia Minor and back
into Syria. They took up their abode in
Alexandria and along the Mediterranean
coast. Wherever they went, they carried<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_117"></a>[117]</span>
their civilization; their synagogue, in which
to teach their knowledge of the one God;
their Moses, to guide by his law their conduct;
and their David, to soothe, with his
songs, their sorrow.</p>

<p>The marvelous productions of Grecian
thought and skill were kept, for a time,
from the barbarians. They attempted a
monopoly of beauty. But the breaking up
of their Commonwealth hastened the coming
of universal fraternity. They planted
their civilization in Asia Minor. They
went over to Syria, down to Alexandria,
and around the Mediterranean Sea. Wherever
they went they carried their language
and their philosophy. The Romans broke
down the walls between different tribes,
and brought them under one law. They
built roads into all parts of the civilized
world, and thus prepared the first great
highways of travel.</p>

<p>Looking from this distance, back upon<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_118"></a>[118]</span>
the movements of these great peoples, it
seems as if they might have been, on set
purpose, devising schemes and laying plans
for bringing the world of mankind together.
It really looks as if all peoples
above the grade of the savage had been
unconsciously and in spite of themselves
working for the unity of the race. The
very walls that have been raised to keep
men apart have been battered down and
used to make roads to bring them together.
The mountains, that served as barriers to
separate them, have been tunneled to unite
them. The oceans, that seemed absolutely
to insure isolation, are now the favorite
means of communication. All inventions
and discoveries have helped to the practical
oneness of the race.</p>

<p>The mariner’s compass, gunpowder, the
printing press, the steam engine, the electric
telegraph, the sewing machine, the
spectroscope, the electric light, the telephone,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_119"></a>[119]</span>
with the phonograph and microphone,
have wrought for this end. The
discovery of the sun’s place in the heavens,
and of the shape and movements of the
earth; the discovery of America and of
the law of gravitation; the discovery of
the circulation of the blood and of the
wonderful remedies in nature which relieve
the ills of the body, have all reduced differences
and augmented unity. Theologies,
which have divided men into religious
partisans, fomenting strife, and producing
wars; which have separated men into
parties bitter and revengeful; have grown
kinder and humaner as the years have
passed, and tend now to unite men, rather
than to divide them. Philosophies, which
kept men apart under the heads of nominalist
and realist, sensationalist and idealist,
are now deduced from a broader
survey of the facts, and tend to harmony
rather than conflict.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_120"></a>[120]</span></p>

<p>From the beginning nature and human
effort have wrought together for universal
good will and social organization. Lapses
have been frequent and the net gain of
fraternity small, but from age to age, without
cessation and without intermission, in
volume and sweep, it has been increasing.</p>

<h3>VIII.</h3>

<p>Because of the limited knowledge men
had of the uses of power in the past, the
growth of universal social organization
has been slow. Methods of intercommunication
between nations wide apart were
meager, hence the people in one division
of the globe could know but little of the
people who lived in another. Any part of
the earth not understood was counted as
desert, and any people not known were
considered barbarian. But with the new
uses and applications of power, all this is
changed. The world now lies open to all.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_121"></a>[121]</span>
The antipodes are neighbors. By hitching
the sun’s heat to the flying train, and the
canvas to the favoring winds, and the
lightning to human thought, all races on
the globe stand face to face. The world is
being encompassed, and no natural obstacles
are now permitted to stand in the way
of railway lines, or of submarine cables.
All mountain chains are being tunneled,
all chasms spanned, all oceans traversed,
and all straits bridged. The continents
of the earth are now connected by 125,000
miles of submarine electric cable, and
countries are crossed by thousands of miles
of railroad lines. With an abiding and irrepressible,
even if unconscious sense, that
on the social side of himself he is related
to the whole human race, man has well-nigh
subdued the earth, and removed the
obstacles that opposed the realization of
his larger nature. Already great enterprises
are being contemplated, which look<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_122"></a>[122]</span>
to the speedy removal of whatever remaining
obstacles there are to world-wide companionship
among men. Some of the
great enterprises already projected which
are to help toward universal brotherhood,
have been noted by Mr. Charles Hallock.
A railway is to be built from Joppa to Jerusalem
in Palestine, and a bridge across
the Straits of Dover near Folkestone.</p>

<p>The Mombasa and Nyanza Railway in
Africa is to connect the Nile with the
interior lakes and with the coast. A railway
is to be constructed across Siberia,
from St. Petersburg to Behring Strait.
Upon this side a railway is to be built
across Alaska to Behring Strait, while
Behring Strait is to be bridged or ferried.
A canal is to be cut across the Isthmus of
Corinth in Greece, to connect the Ægean
Sea with the Gulf of Corinth. There is to
be a ship canal around Niagara Falls, and
a railroad from Quebec to Belle Isle in<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_123"></a>[123]</span>
Labrador, with connecting ocean steamship
lines to Medford in Wales. There is
to be an ocean cable from Clew Bay, Ireland,
to Greeny Island, Strait of Belle Isle,
1900 miles long. And a railroad from
Winnipeg, Manitoba, to Hudson Bay, and
steamship line thence to Liverpool.</p>

<p>A railway is contemplated from Winnipeg
to the Saskatchewan River, across the
Northwest Territory. A tunnel is to be
cut under the Hudson River at New York,
and a tunnel under the St. Clair River,
between Sarnia and Port Huron, Mich.
That the Panama and Nicaragua canals
have been projected and partially completed
is known the world over. A tunnel is to
be made through the Atlas Mountains in
Russia, and the great Northern Railroad
Company is to make one through the Rocky
Mountains in Montana, and another is to be
cut through the Sierras from Truckee River,
Nevada, into California. There is to be a<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_124"></a>[124]</span>
canal from Knoxville, Tenn., through Alabama
to the Gulf of Mexico, and one from
Chicago to the Mississippi River, which is
to cost $25,000,000. A ship railway 60
miles long is to be completed from Georgian
Bay to Lake Ontario, connecting the
Great Lakes and the St. Lawrence River,
costing $12,000,000. A canal is contemplated
from Chicago to the Gulf of Mexico,
and also a ship railway around the Dalles
of the Columbia River. There is to be a
ship canal across New Jersey to the Atlantic
Ocean, 60 miles long, and a ship railway
to connect the Gulf of St Lawrence
with the Bay of Fundy, 12 miles long, to
cost $12,000,000. There are to be steam
lines from Tampa, Fla., to all parts of
the West Indies, a longitudinal railway
through the axis of North and South
America, from Chicago to the Argentine
Republic; steam lines from Vancouver in
British Columbia, to Japan and Australia,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_125"></a>[125]</span>
and steam lines from New York to the
Carribbees and the Windward Islands.
There are to be steam lines from Scotland
to the North Cape and the Antarctic
Ocean; stated voyages between Sitka,
Alaska, and Point Barrow in the Arctic
Ocean, and steamboat navigation of all
the great lakes and rivers of Siberia,
British America, and Central Africa.
Ports of entry are to be established in
all countries to furnish terminal facilities
for these far reaching lines of transportation.</p>

<p>We are to have federation among the
nations, as we now have it among the
States of the American Union. The social
cohesion, once national, is to be international.
All are to think for each, and each
is to think for all. All are to work for
each, and each is to work for all. All are
to plan for the good of each, and each is to
plan for the good of all. Thus the inequalities<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_126"></a>[126]</span>
of life are to be reduced, and the littleness
of life is to be redressed.</p>

<p>As all the power in the vine and its
branches to make grapes is expended in
the rounding and sweetening of each grape,
so all the power in the social whole to
make men will be reproduced in each man.
All the justice in the race will regulate
each man’s will, all the thought in the race
will replenish each man’s mind, and all the
love in the race will feed each man’s heart.
Nothing less than this social whole, in
which are bound together in one organic
body the lives, the welfare, and the hopes
of all, is the correlate of the social nature
of man. Toward such a world-wide organism,
each living in the whole and the whole
living in each, his social nature reaches out
and is never at home until it is found.
Such universal brotherhood would be impossible
without power in all its manifold
forms. This serves the social body as<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_127"></a>[127]</span>
bread serves the individual body. Power,
as the servant of the social body, waits on
each man through his relations with the
social whole. A city builds gas works and
finds it possible to let down the price in
proportion to the number of those who use
it. A railroad company can lower the rate
on passengers and freight in proportion to
the number of men who travel and the
volume of freight transported. The price
of a newspaper goes up or down as the
number of subscribers increases or diminishes.
Mr. Edison expects to get electricity
from the disturbed conditions of the air,
without the use of fuel. This will make
the conditions of life easier by one-half;
and then, as the number of people increases
who avail themselves of the uses of power,
the conditions of living will still be easier.
Not only will the unity which comes
through social organization lower the rate
of insurance and the price of the necessities<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_128"></a>[128]</span>
of life, but this increased force of the
social whole will tend to the moral health
of the people in the same degree. Health
in one part of the body will be brought to
bear to correct disease in another part.
The conscience of the whole will be turned
into the degraded sections of our great
cities, and the sympathy and love of all
will be called out to reclaim them. Starvation
in one part of the globe will be met
by the over-supply of bread in another.
Oppression and tyranny in one nation will
be opposed by the sense of fairness and
overcome by the love of freedom in all the
rest. As climatic conditions are made
friendly to life by the circulation of
oceanic and atmospheric currents, so moral
health will be preserved by the circulation
of the currents of conscience and
justice.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_129"></a>[129]</span></p>

<h3>IX.</h3>

<p>The emphasis is to be kept on the social
rather than the individual side of human
nature; not that personality may be lost,
but that it may be gained.</p>

<p>The social mass that constricts and
squeezes the single life until the virility of
self-assertion and the right of private initiative
are destroyed, is no improvement on
Bedouin isolation. The latter brutalizes
life, while the former eviscerates it. The
eye does not lose its capacity for sight,
and its place of peculiar responsibility by
being brought into reciprocal relations
along with other organs in the same body.
It would have no meaning and no power
of vision apart from relations with other
organs. The ear is not discounted, nor are
its wonderful functions belittled amid the
manifold members which work together in
the same human frame. Its position of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_130"></a>[130]</span>
honor is secured to it by the organic relations
it sustains to the other members.
The foot, the hand, and the tongue find
themselves and their uses as they unite
together in one living whole. The lone
Bedouin, with no laws and no relations,
seems to have all liberty, but in reality he
has none. He is as completely without
meaning as would be the finger separated
from the hand. The man of whom nature
is a prophecy is not the being in the woods
whose home is a cave and whose food is
wild meat; but it is the man in society,
whose home all woods and metals and
stones have helped to build, and whose food
all soils and skies and seas have helped to
produce.</p>

<p>The emphasis is to be kept on the social
side of human nature, because it is through
that side of himself that man is to pass into
the world-wide work and the glorious
destiny for which he is fitted. Through<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_131"></a>[131]</span>
that side of himself he moves out into order,
and strength, and freedom. All men whose
names are cherished in history, passed into
place, influence, and honor through the
social side of human nature.</p>

<p>In passing through the social side of
himself, the life man finds is a million times
larger and richer than the life he loses.
That men might find the life that belonged
to them, the only life worth living, the
tendency from the first has been toward
the solidarity of the race. The relations
growing out of such solidarity are constitutive
of the being of each man. The important
properties of an acid cannot be
known, when it is considered out of relation
with an alkali. What a thing is for
another, that it is in itself. So what a
man is through relations with others, that
he is in himself. But what he is in himself
cannot be known until he comes into relations
with others.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_132"></a>[132]</span></p>

<p>Solidarity is not to swamp single lives,
but single lives are to come to all that is
peculiar and high in themselves through
solidarity. The universe is to preserve
relations with each private spirit. By the
organization of men into one social whole,
provision is made for each man to participate
in the life of humanity. It is intended
that all the oceans of life shall reach,
through their waves, the shores of each
man’s being, and leave deposits of all their
wealth in each man’s spirit. When we speak
of the horse, the eagle, the whale, it is understood
that we are using generic terms, and
are intended to refer to no particular horse
or eagle or whale. Yet in each horse the
species is reproduced, and in each eagle
the species is epitomized, and in each whale
the whole whale type is summarized. This
is done in the case of the lower animals,
without their thought or volition. No
universal relations are necessary among<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_133"></a>[133]</span>
whales, for each whale to have within itself
all the peculiarities and furnishments
possessed by all whales. The species are
to be realized in each man, too; but this is
to be accomplished through social relations
among all men. All the men in the world
must touch each man, to call forth the
capacities which lie folded within his life.
Humanity, as parcelled out in nations,
generations, epochs, must lift itself into
the being of each man; as the ocean, parcelled
out in Atlantics, Pacifics, Indians,
Arctics, Antarctics, lifts itself into each
wave.</p>

<p>Power, parcelled out in gravitation, heat,
and electricity surrounding the globe; advertised
in every apple’s fall, declared in
every flash from the clouds, and present in
every sunbeam; stands ready to make
universal brotherhood, not simply an ideal,
running through the dreams of poets and
prophets, but an actual fact. The recognition<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_134"></a>[134]</span>
of power, as the provision made
for the social nature of man, is enabling
us to realize the dreams of prophets and
poets.</p>

<span class="smaller">THE PROVISION FOR THE INTELLECTUAL NATURE OF MAN.</span></h2>

</div>

<p>Truth and reality stand for the same
thing. Reality is truth out of the mind,
and truth is reality in the mind. Reality
is objective truth, and truth is subjective
reality. But all reality is in relation to
mind; objective reality to the divine mind,
and subjective reality to the human
mind. Objective reality is the realized
thought of God; subjective reality is the
realized thought of man. The correspondence
of thoughts to things is called scientific
truth. Objective reality is truth,
because it corresponds to the thought of
God. Knowledge in the human mind is
truth when it corresponds to objective reality<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_138"></a>[138]</span>
or the expressed thought of God.
When words and conduct correspond to
knowledge, we have truth in the domain of
morals.</p>

<p>In saying that objective reality is the
realized thought of God, we denote its
unity. This is not to destroy the particulars
of which it is composed, or to swamp
their individuality in an inarticulate mass,
but simply to indicate their oneness.</p>

<p>When the observer looks out into the
universe, which includes and shuts him
round, he is impressed by the infinite varieties
and diversities which everywhere meet
his gaze. No two things are alike. No
two leaves, no two drops of water, no two
snowflakes, no two apples, no two faces.
Every particular thing seems to be persistently
determined to differ, in some respect
at least, from everything else. The history
of true knowledge begins, however, with
the observation of resemblance and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_139"></a>[139]</span>
similarity—just beneath the surface of difference
and variety. The lightning that
appears on the bosom of the cloud, like the
writing of some awful fiend, is seen to be
the same with the gentle sparks emitted
when a tag of silken ribbon is drawn
briskly between the fingers. The power
that pulls the ball to the ground is seen to
be the same as that which keeps the sun
in his place.</p>

<p>The plant lifts itself up as but a sum of
organized varieties; but every part, corolla,
petal, and stamen, is known to be only
modified leaf. Keeping to their silent and
lonely rounds since the dawn of time, are
the stars in the heavens, differing in color,
orbit, and size, but we now know that to
understand the elements of which they are
composed, we have only to lift our foot
and see what the constituent parts of the
earth beneath it are. Were objective reality
one amorphous mass, it would not be<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_140"></a>[140]</span>
intelligible. It is one and many, particular
and universal, singular and manifold, concrete
and discrete. All things cohere in
a centrality that includes and commands
them.</p>

<p>So true is it that unity underlies all difference,
that no single variety can be understood,
only as it is considered in relation
with the whole of which it forms a part.</p>

<p>No one could ever get a correct notion of
a particular star by directing his entire attention
to the study of that star. To
understand it, he must study it through the
system of which it forms a member, and in
connection with all laws and forces related
to it. Oxygen separate and distinct from
other elements has no meaning. It gets its
definition and significance from the things
to which it is related. What it is for
rocks and water and trees and globes, that
it is in itself. But it must be seen in connection
with these before we can know<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_141"></a>[141]</span>
what it is in itself. What an acid is for
an alkali and for other things, that it is in
itself. Alone, out of relation, we could
know absolutely nothing of it. Society is
the organism that reveals to each person
the nature of his own life. Out of contact
and touch with other human beings, no
one would ever know anything concerning
himself.</p>

<p>Objective reality embraces manifold
variety, but it is the unity that presides
over it that makes it intelligible. Difference
provokes questions and unity
answers them.</p>

<p>In calling objective reality truth, we
tacitly assume the laws and relations constitutive
of it. We could not speak of
the truth of the globe, had there been no
method in its formation, no order in its
development, no system in its parts, and
no relations between its constituent elements.
To speak of the truth of it, is to<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_142"></a>[142]</span>
imply the thought of it, the intelligibility
of it. Were it not the expression of mind,
man’s reason could find no truth in it.
Scholars have been able, after long and
painstaking study, to understand the
meaning of Egyptian and Assyrian hieroglyphics,
but they never could have found
thought in them, had they contained no
thought. The original elements which
make up the matter of the globe, have
come into such relations with one another
as that they make up the soil, rocks, water,
trees, and animals we see. Thought, then,
is the result of the internal relations of
the particles which compose it. These
internal relations, too, constitute its intelligibility.
The globe that wheels on its
axis is objective. This may be taken into
the mind, and by its synthesizing, organizing
activity converted into a subjective
globe. The difference between
the objective and the subjective globe<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_143"></a>[143]</span>
will be, that one will be thought
and the other will be thing. But the
same internal relations found in the objective
globe will be preserved in the
subjective, and the transcript of the globe
that is held in thought will be truth in
exact proportion as it corresponds to the
material globe that rolls out of the mind.
That an objective globe, which is a thing,
may become a subjective globe, which is a
thought and not a thing, implies that there
is something in common between thoughts
and things; that is, the mind, by its constitution,
is capable of apprehending and
taking into itself the constitution and
relations of things. This is its capacity
for truth, and shows that truth is not
foreign to it, but one with itself.</p>

<p>The sides and angles of a right angle
triangle have certain relations to one another.
The square described on the
hypotenuse of such an angle is equal to<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_144"></a>[144]</span>
the squares described on the other two
sides. This may be demonstrated on a
piece of blank paper, or the mind may conceive
a right angle triangle, and prove the
proposition without making any marks at
all. The constitutional relations which
were in the nature of a right angle triangle
are the same, whether it be drawn
on paper or conceived by the imagination.
The relations of the triangle make it
intelligible, because they constitute its
truth.</p>

<h3>I.</h3>

<p>To truth the intellect is related, as is the
eye to light, and the ear to sound. If the
eye were destroyed, the sun would not
cease to shine. His light would still come
upon hill and plain to feed the flowers and
to disclose their beauty, but without the
organ of vision no creature in the universe
would be able to see the things which his
light reveals. The ear does not create<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_145"></a>[145]</span>
sound. Let it be forever sealed, and the
Niagaras would still continue to fall and
the thunders to shake the heavens, but
they would not be heard. The intellect
does not create truth, but it is the only
faculty with which man is endowed by
which he is able to discover it.</p>

<p>It was the error of the idealists that they
made the order, laws, and relations of things
as so many principles projected out of the
observer’s own mind into the universe
about him. What he seemed to see in
things, were but modifications of his own
mental states. The only order things had
was in the observer’s own mind. It was
regarded not only as the pivot upon which
the universe turned, but also as the creative
principle from which the universe
took form. Apparently this was a great
gain to mind, but it was at the expense of
any real world for the mind to contemplate.
It seemed to win a victory for the intelligence<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_146"></a>[146]</span>
absolute and entire, but it was by
shutting it up to its own shadowy abstractions,
and abandoning it in a shoreless and
bottomless void to its own vain musings.
The personal pronoun <i>I</i> was extended perpendicularly
and horizontally, till topways
and sideways the whole of space and time
was filled with it. No solid earth, no burning
sun, no rolling orbs were left. A great,
illimitable, irresponsible ego became the
sole occupant of all that is.</p>

<p>This extreme idealism is in direct contrast
to the realism of the early thinkers.
They taught that things depended on man
neither for their existence nor their intelligibility.
That each thing carried the real
intelligible essence as an ultimate fact in
itself. Thought in man was but the reflection
of this intelligible essence in the thing,
as the light in the mirror is but the reflection
of the light of the lamp.</p>

<p>Of the two systems, extreme idealism is<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_147"></a>[147]</span>
preferable to extreme realism. All mind
and no matter, is better than all matter and
no mind. Thought with no place to stand,
is better than a place to stand and no
thought. The eye with nothing to see, is
better than something to see and no eye.</p>

<p>The solution which realism gave of the
problem of existence, left no place for
mind, the solution which idealism gave of
it left no place for matter. But both the
external world, upon which realism was
founded, and the intelligence, upon which
idealism was founded, are expressions of
mind. The one as intelligible content, the
other as combining active capacity and the
intelligibility of the content, exactly corresponds
to the active grasp of the capacity.</p>

<h3>II.</h3>

<p>But it must be remembered that the intellect
which is the organ of truth, and
objective reality which is abstract truth, do<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_148"></a>[148]</span>
not come together to form knowledge in
any accidental way.</p>

<p>A basket may be said to have capacity
for holding potatoes, and potatoes may lend
themselves as content to fill up the basket.
But the union of potatoes and basket; the
one as content, the other as capacity, is
only mechanical. The basket would serve
as well to hold onions, or muskadines, or
chinquepins, as potatoes, and the potatoes
could be carried as well in a wooden box
or in a tin pan, as in a basket. No necessity
inheres in the nature of a basket to
contain potatoes, and no necessity is in the
nature of potatoes to get into a basket.
Truth and the intellect, however, are intended
the one for the other. Truth is
correlated to the intellect as the bird’s wing
is to the atmosphere. Nothing can take
hold of the truth but the intellect, and nothing
can satisfy and furnish the intellect but
truth.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_149"></a>[149]</span></p>

<p>Abstract truth, or objective reality, is
converted by the combining organizing activity
of the mind into knowledge, and
when this knowledge corresponds to the
reality it is truth in the realm of
thought.</p>

<p>Before knowledge is possible, then, there
must be an intelligence capable of knowing,
and an object capable of being known.</p>

<p>How the intelligence and the knowable
object get together to form knowledge is
the most important question in philosophy.
Upon the right settlement of it, everything
depends. This has been the point about
which the battle of thought, in modern
times, has been most fiercely waged. If
the mind firmly grasps the meaning of this
problem and settles it right, it is almost
sure to think right on other questions. If
it is wrong here, it is sure to be wrong everywhere
else. Mistake here is as fatal to the
correct solution of the question we are considering,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_150"></a>[150]</span>
as would be the mistake that two
and two make five to the correct solution of
a sum in arithmetic.</p>

<h3>III.</h3>

<p>The distance of a question from ordinary
thought does not render it any the less important,
even for ordinary thinking. How
the knowing intelligence and the knowable
object get together to form knowledge is
the most important problem to-day before
the human mind. If writers would only
take their bearings from the only rational
solution that can be given to it, they would
find half the books they are writing on the
inspiration of the Scriptures, the existence
of God, the divinity of Jesus Christ,
agnosticism and materialism, unnecessary.</p>

<p>Agnosticism and materialism pass away
with a correct theory of knowing. Labor
and painstaking thought are involved in<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_151"></a>[151]</span>
the task of getting a right theory of knowledge,
but agnosticism and materialism are
in line with ignorance and indolence.</p>

<p>So, while few men ever ask themselves
how the knowing intelligence and the knowable
object get together to form knowledge,
millions of men are affected, even in their
practical life, by the answer which is given
to the question. Someone has said that not
more than six men in any one age ever read
Plato or understand him. Yet for the six
men Plato comes down through the ages.
The six men who understand him translate
him into the vernacular of the one hundred
men who live on the next plane of thought
below them.</p>

<p>The one hundred translate him into the
common language of one thousand below
them. These, in turn, translate Plato into
the ordinary thought of the millions below
them. So it happens at length that Plato
gets so universally known, that not a<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_152"></a>[152]</span>
laborer in the field but wears his hat after
one style, rather than another, because
Plato wrote.</p>

<p>Doubtless it would have been considered
a very unimportant question two hundred
years ago, as to whether heat were an
igneous fluid or a mode of motion. Perhaps
not more than two or three men
wrestled with the question for centuries
before it was settled. By the masses of
the people they were regarded as wasting
their time in vain and idle speculation.
By an experiment made by Count Rumford,
it was put beyond the possibility of
doubt that heat was not an igneous fluid,
but a mode of motion. Was this a question
that concerned the multitudes, that
two or three men spent a hundred years
talking about and torturing their brains to
understand? There is not a single human
being in the civilized world to-day whose
interests and welfare have not been touched<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_153"></a>[153]</span>
by the settlement of it. There are millions
of peasants in Russia who never heard of
Count Rumford, or of an igneous fluid, or
of caloric, who have this present year been
fed by flour sent them by the western
millers and transported on the strength of
the conclusion that heat is not an igneous
fluid, but a mode of motion. Every steam-car
that crosses the continent, and every
steamboat that crosses the ocean, moves in
the wake of this same conclusion. At first
we see some algebraic formulas, an array of
curves and figures, that practical people
said had nothing to do with everyday life.
After a while we see the abstract conclusions
reached by aid of the algebraic
signs, and settled by the test of experiment,
translated into steam engines, and transporting
even the peasants of India and
Mexico from one end of the country to the
other. We see the abstract conclusions
of the few thinkers turned into steam to<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_154"></a>[154]</span>
spin the people’s clothes and grind the
people’s bread.</p>

<p>In 1632 there was born at Wrington,
Somersetshire, England, a boy, who was
educated at the University of Oxford. In
the esteem of his contemporaries he devoted
his time to the consideration of subjects
of no practical value. In the course
of events he put the results of his study
into a book known as “The Essay on the
Human Understanding.” Few people read
it. But the few who did read it started the
ideas of it to circulating. They were translated
into French and Latin, and were soon
potent influences in the intellectual life of
Europe. Were they practical and did they
concern the ordinary affairs of men? They
created the Encyclopedists of France.
These learned men were the authors of the
radical opinions which cut the people from
the moorings of traditional and age-long
thought. The fire and the blood of the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_155"></a>[155]</span>
Revolution were the legitimate expressions
of the speculative essay of John Locke that
not one in ten thousand ever read. The
persons whose heads were cut off in the
Reign of Terror must have thought the
ideas exceedingly practical that led to the
destruction of social and political institutions,
that took form in a movement which
respected neither law nor property nor life.
The speculative opinions of John Locke
not only helped to create the French Revolution,
but they led to the idealism of
Bishop Berkeley, and this in turn to the
skeptical philosophy of David Hume. The
modern successors of Hume are John Stuart
Mill, Herbert Spencer, Leslie Stephen,
Frederic Harrison, and Professor Huxley,
whose contributions have been given to the
popular reviews, and which have been read
by all intelligent people. Every man in
Europe and America has been influenced
both in conduct and character by the speculative<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_156"></a>[156]</span>
“Essay on the Human Understanding.”</p>

<p>Locke’s speculative philosophy passed
through Berkeley to Hume, and through
Hume reached Kant, the great German
thinker, and resulted in the “Critique of
Pure Reason.” This led to Fichte and
Schelling, and finally to Hegel. This led
to Heidelberg and the Tübingen school, to
Bauer and Dewette, to extreme idealism
and rationalism, translated into books and
reviews and newspapers, and read by all
the people, affecting their thought and life.</p>

<p>Even people who never read, who never
open a book or a newspaper, have been
influenced by the subtle piece of speculative
reasoning given to the world by the
great sensational philosopher of England.
The spirit of utilitarianism and secularism
prevalent throughout the world at the
present time is easily traceable to it.</p>

<h3>IV.</h3>

<p>Before we can possibly know that truth
is the provision for the intellectual nature
of man, we must determine whether the
knowing faculties, which he finds himself
to possess, are capable of grasping truth
and turning it into knowledge. The fight
of skepticism in modern times has been
made upon the knowing faculties. It is
useless to talk about the existence of God,
the inspiration of the Scriptures, the divinity
of Christ, or the immortality of the soul,
if the human intellect is, by its limitations,
denied the possibility of knowing anything
whatsoever concerning these things. It is
a waste of time for me to attempt to dip
water out of the ocean with a bucket with
no bottom to it. What is the relation of
the intelligence to the outer world? Does
the outside world create knowledge in the
mind by the impressions it makes upon it,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_158"></a>[158]</span>
or does the mind bring something to the
outside world which converts this raw material
into knowledge? Is knowledge a reflection
of the outer, or a creation of the
inner? Does nature work it in us, or is
there some spontaneous, creative, organizing,
mental activity within us that takes
the material presented by nature, turning
it into a rational system of knowledge?
What is the relation between the being
that knows and the object known? How
much of the creative factor of knowledge
does nature supply? How much does man
supply? Can a man with deranged faculties
get order out of a rational world? Can
a man of sane mind get order out of an
irrational world? If there is to be a rational
system of knowledge built up in the
mind, must there not be reason in the
thinker and reason in the outside world,
coming into organic relations, the one with
the other? As to how we regard this<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_159"></a>[159]</span>
question will determine how we regard
truth, and whether or not it is possible for
us to know it.</p>

<h3>V.</h3>

<p>The human mind has never been able to
resist the conviction that there is such a
thing as truth. Though baffled and defeated
a thousand times, in every age, in its
attempt to formulate truth, it has never
been able to consent to give up the search
for it. Interest in truth has kept alive and
fostered the belief that the mind has power
to understand it. The mind’s passion for
truth has deepened its confidence in the
faculties with which it is ever trying to discover
it. The everlasting longing to know
truth has been taken as implicit capacity to
find it. Philosophic systems have been
only so many devices and creations of the
mind with which to take hold of truth.
The methods proposed, in the first stages<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_160"></a>[160]</span>
of philosophic thinking, for getting at the
truth were crude, as the first instruments
devised for cultivating the soil and getting
out of it what there was in it for food,
were crude. Thales, Pythagoras, and
Anaximander first attempted to penetrate
objective reality, to know its cause, to
bring its multiplicity to unity, and to reduce
its variety to law. The ever-changing
phenomena by which they were surrounded
necessarily eluded the meager theories with
which they attempted to reduce them to
order. They prepared the way, however,
for systems which accommodated a greater
number of facts. They made possible Plato
and Aristotle, who, with hypotheses more
complicated and more consonant with the
reality they sought to grasp, found truth
enough to keep the human race thinking
for two thousand years. The blocks of
truth they quarried from the mines of objective
reality were used to carry up the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_161"></a>[161]</span>
theological and speculative temples of the
Middle Ages.</p>

<p>After the failure of scholasticism, which
denotes a period in human thought rather
than a particular system of philosophy,
Lord Bacon proposed the method of material
induction to bring the mind into
relations of knowledge with truth. He
emphasized the study of the outward facts,
their classification and organization. In
his esteem, truth was to be reached by the
consideration of actual, tangible things.
Man was the interpreter of nature, and not
necessarily its interpretation.</p>

<p>Truth in the mind was the image of
objective truth. It differed from truth out
of the mind, as the direct from the reflected
ray. He failed from lack of adequate
recognition of one of the important factors
in the problem of truth. Descartes’ method
was more successful, because larger and
completer recognition was taken of man.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_162"></a>[162]</span></p>

<p>He began by doubting everything that
could be doubted. Heir to the beliefs of
all the ages, he determined to summon
these, one by one, before the bar of reason,
and force them to show cause for their
existence. Everyone was to be called into
court and put out that could be doubted.
The existence of a God was called up and
doubted, condemned, and put out. The
existence of an external world was called
up, doubted, condemned, and put out. In
the same summary and shorthand way,
man and mind were doubted and put out.
All positive beliefs were doubted. After
his process of elimination, he found himself
without God, without man, without mind,
without a permanent external world. All
that remained after emptying himself of all
mental furnishments and beliefs was the
fact that he doubted. But he could not
doubt without thinking. In the very act
of doubting, he thought. If one thinks,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_163"></a>[163]</span>
he must think something. The nearest
something to the thinking subject is his
own personal being. So he thought himself
and concluded, “I think, therefore, I
am.” But he was not always; he began
to be. So he must think of a being
that caused him. The being that caused
him must himself be uncaused. Moreover,
there could not be an uncaused
cause, without an effect. Creation, then,
with which he stood face to face, was the
effect of the great first cause. Thus Descartes’
method, based upon the thought
underlying doubt, led him, necessarily, to
himself, the object of his thought; and to
God, the cause of himself; and to creation,
the effect of the great first cause or God.
Through his process of coming at the problem,
he was able, rationally, to believe in
the existence of himself, the outer world,
and God, the cause of both. Descartes, as
a thinker, was affirmative, positive, constructive.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_164"></a>[164]</span>
He only doubted down to the
point where he could doubt no longer, that
he might have a sure foundation upon which
to build. His contribution gave fresh courage
and inspiration to the human mind.
He failed to determine the boundary
line between the self and the not-self,
between mind and matter, between the
thinker and the creation with which he
stood face to face. This was the work
Spinoza proposed for himself, and in the
celebrated Ethics, published to the world
at the peril of his life and soul, imagined
the task mathematically performed. The
two poles of Descartes’ philosophy, the self
and the not-self, he united in Descartes’ cause,
and named the whole sum substance. The
self and the not-self reappeared as attributes
of substance, which Spinoza named thought
and extension. All the phenomena in the
universe, mental or material, were but
modes of the infinite substance. The<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_165"></a>[165]</span>
result of his thinking was pure pantheism.
He reached a sort of mechanical unity, but
he left no place for the affirmation of distinctions.
His Ethics was large enough to
accommodate everything, but in such a way
as to preserve the individuality of nothing.
A thought is valuable in proportion to its
capacity to take hold of things as they are.
The old opinion that heat was caloric,
served as a working hypothesis for the mind
a long time. In the view of those who
held it, it was satisfactory and adequate.
But it never really got hold of heat, because
it contradicted the nature of heat.
The astronomers thought, for a long time,
that they had come into relations of knowledge
with the stars through the Ptolemaic
conception of the heavenly bodies. They
were mistaken, however. Their theory did
not fit the real celestial order at all. As a
work of genius, Spinoza’s Ethics is one of
the most remarkable productions ever formulated<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_166"></a>[166]</span>
by the human intellect, but it conducted
the mind away from truth, rather
than into relations with it. Locke began
his work as a philosopher, as Descartes
began his, by looking into his own mind.
Descartes began by casting out everything
that could be doubted. Locke began by
making an inventory of what his mind contained.
Descartes wanted to find out how
much he could know, as measured by what
remained after throwing out everything
that could be doubted. Locke sought to
see how little he could know, by putting
the sensations and impressions he found in
his mind on the witness stand, and getting
them to tell how they came to be there,
and where they came from. Descartes
began by a study of the intelligence, the
instrument of knowledge. Locke began by
a study of the facts which, by some means
or other, had found their way into his
intelligence. Descartes got rid of every<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_167"></a>[167]</span>
belief that could be doubted. Locke ran
every idea out of his mind that had been
imported from the outside world, in order
that he might see if the mind had any constitutional
power to produce any. Descartes,
having dislodged all inherited beliefs,
such as took for granted the existence of
God, man, mind, and outer world, found
some mental laws, capabilities, and tendencies
left, which compelled a man, if he
thought at all, to think in a given way;
and if he thought on given lines, to think
to a given conclusion. Not being able to
get these laws out of the mind, he called
them innate ideas. They were in the
mind by structure and constitution.</p>

<p>After Locke had carefully examined
the contents of his mind, he declared
they were all imported from an outside
realm. Nothing he found in the mind
was indigenous to the soil. When all
foreign importations were removed, nothing<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_168"></a>[168]</span>
remained but an empty vessel. The
mind was nothing but a receptacle, into
which the senses dumped such objects as
they happened to find lying round loose
in the outside world. It had no more
power to understand or turn into thought
what was brought in than a piece of white
paper had to read and interpret what was
written upon it; or than a kettle to recognize
the liquid making up its contents as
water. It is like a table of wax; any sort
of letters may be graven upon it, but the
table cannot read them.</p>

<p>Locke proposed to find out what the
mind could know by counting and tabulating
the things he found in his own intelligence.
This is very much like trying to
understand the nature of light, by considering
the blue things and green things and
red things the light discloses. All bodies,
it is said, which the light enables us to
see, attract each other in proportion to<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_169"></a>[169]</span>
their mass, and inversely as the squares of
their distance. The law of gravity, which
regulates the bodies light reveals to us, is
not the law of light. We can never understand
the nature of light, or the laws of
light, by the study of things which light
enables us to see. If all knowledge is but
the sum of the impressions which the external
world has made on the mind, then
the cause of knowledge is matter, and
knowledge is but the image or reflection
of material things. Knowledge, then,
would sustain the same relation to the outside
world, that the shadow of a tree does
to the tree. One would come as near
lifting up the tree by its own shadow as
lifting up the truth by Locke’s system of
sensational philosophy.</p>

<p>Impressions are simple, atomic. They
come into the mind, one after another.
They cohere in no unity. They are held
together by no necessary relation. They<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_170"></a>[170]</span>
are separate, one from the other. If there
is no primary, innate faculty; no abiding
and indwelling mental activity, that lies
behind, and determines and co-ordinates
the objects which nature supplies through
the senses, converting them into rational,
orderly knowledge, then we can never get
hold of truth. We are shut up to hopeless
ignorance.</p>

<h3>VI.</h3>

<p>Berkeley, in order to escape the materialism
to which Locke’s philosophy led,
accepted his theory of knowledge, but destroyed
his outward, material world. In
his view, there was no matter, nothing but
ideas. The impressions conveyed through
the senses into our minds are but reflections
of the ideas of God.</p>

<p>In Hume, the empirical theory of knowing
found a disciple who did not hesitate
to affirm all that was involved in it.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_171"></a>[171]</span>
Locke said there was an outward world,
and knowledge was its image. Berkeley
said there was no material world; that
knowledge was the reflection of God’s ideas.
Hume said there was neither outer world
nor inner; that there was nothing but impressions,
sensations, ideas, in perpetual flow
and flux. He claimed that all ideas which
could not be resolved into impressions
were false. He declared we could have no
ideas of substance, because, if perceived by
the eye, it must be a color; if by the ear, a
sound; if by the palate, a taste. And because
we could not think of substance as a
color or a sound or a taste, we could therefore
have no idea of it whatever. Belief
in a permanent external world was rendered
irrational by his theory of knowledge.
Nothing is more vital and irrepressible
than belief in one’s own existence,
but even this could not be retained
in accordance with the teachings of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_172"></a>[172]</span>
Hume’s philosophy. “Whence,” says he,
“could the impression of the idea of self
be derived? What impression could
create this idea? This question it is impossible
to answer without a manifest contradiction
and absurdity, and yet it is a
question that must necessarily be answered.
For my part, when I enter most intimately
into what I call myself, I always
stumble upon some perception or other;
heat or cold, light or shade, pain or
pleasure. I cannot catch myself at any
time without a perception, or observe anything
but a perception. When my perceptions
are removed at any time, as by
sound sleep, so long am I insensible of myself,
and may be said truly not to exist.”</p>

<p>The sensational philosophy which promised
so much, which appeared so eminently
practical, that took to itself such an air of
common sense as it got about obliterating
innate ideas, was seen at length to be<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_173"></a>[173]</span>
utterly impotent. It corresponded with
absolutely nothing in heaven or in earth.
The very impressions it admitted, passed
through it like drops of water out of a
fisherman’s net. Where the impressions
came from or where they went to, it furnished
no means of knowing. God and
world and cause and law and self might
be, but the human mind could never know
whether they were or not. The human
observer stood before a procession of
images, sensations, perceptions going by
like an unending circus troupe.</p>

<p>In Hume may be traced the entire breakdown
of empirical philosophy as a method
for getting at the truth. He recognized
this himself. “When I turn my eye inward,”
he says, “I find nothing but doubt
and ignorance.” “The understanding, when
it acts alone, and according to its most
general principles, entirely subverts itself,
and leaves not the lowest degree of evidence<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_174"></a>[174]</span>
in any proposition, either in philosophy
or common life.” “We have, therefore,
no choice left, but betwixt a false
reason and none at all.”</p>

<h3>VII.</h3>

<p>The most remarkable thing in the whole
search for truth, is that anybody after
Hume should have attempted to find it
with Hume’s principles. Yet the two best
known writers who have lived in England
since Hume’s day, have rested their dogmatic
doctrines on the foundations laid by
the sensational philosophers. Hume’s impressions
and ideas became John Stuart
Mill’s permanent possibilities of sensation
and feeling, and Herbert Spencer’s vivid
and faint manifestations of the unknowable.
In our time Herbert Spencer has
undertaken the herculean task of explaining
matter and mind, time and space,
society and morals; of showing what they<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_175"></a>[175]</span>
are and what they are not, by the same
principles which Hume himself demonstrated
to be incapable of explaining anything.
Spencer’s units of knowledge are
vivid and faint manifestations of the Unknown.
How the unknowable remains
unknown, after vividly and faintly manifesting
itself, we are not told. Mr.
Spencer’s vivid and faint manifestations of
the unknown are old acquaintances with
new names.</p>

<p>Locke knew them as impressions and
sensations. Berkeley recognized them as
ideas of sense and imagination. John
Stuart Mill was on speaking terms with
them as permanent possibilities of sensation
and feeling. Mr. Spencer gives them
another baptism and another name. He
calls them vivid and faint manifestations
of the unknowable. While they have been
changed in name, however, it must not be
supposed that they have undergone any<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_176"></a>[176]</span>
change in nature or character. They stand
apart, the one from the other, just the same
as ever. They are just as foreign to the
mind, where they vividly and faintly manifest
themselves, as were the impressions of
John Locke. They flare and flicker, rise
and fall, like the jack-o’-lantern lights of
legend and tale. One light is not of a piece
with any other light. The lights follow
one another in such quick succession, first
vivid, then faint, that one cannot tell from
the momentary flames and flashes what is
intended to be advertised. That something
is trying, by various pyrotechnic displays,
to get itself revealed seems to be evident.
But there is such hurry on the part of the
something that makes the manifestations,
such a disorderly whirl and changing of
lights, that the observer is totally bewildered;
and, being under the necessity of
making some account to himself as to their
meaning, concludes that they are vivid and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_177"></a>[177]</span>
faint illuminations of the unknowable.
Hume’s procession of sensations and ideas
has by Spencer been converted into the
fire-works of the unknowable. With
Hume’s physiological theory, the mind
could know nothing but its own sensations.
Spencer’s vivid and faint manifestations of
the unknowable are equally as incapable
of furnishing any rational basis for belief
in mind or matter, law or cause, self or God.
To ask the human mind to believe the encyclopedic,
dogmatic system of philosophy
he addressed to it, after insisting that all
our knowledge is but the sum of vivid and
faint manifestations of the unknowable, is
as irrational as trying to build a cathedral
on a London fog bank. Underneath every
one of Spencer’s general terms, the indestructibility
of matter, the continuity of
motion, the persistence of force, there is
nothing but sensations, vivid or faint manifestations
of the unknown.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_178"></a>[178]</span></p>

<p>“The doctrine of the indestructibility of
matter,” he says, “has now become a commonplace.”
“Matter never either comes
into existence, or ceases to exist.” How
are we to know this, with minds incapable
of any other knowledge except such as is
made up of vivid and faint manifestations
of the unknown? Who ever had a sensation
or a manifestation of the indestructibility
of matter? This is an idea involving
all past time and all future time, and
all the laws and forces by which matter is
regulated and conserved. How could an
image of the indestructibility of matter be
photographed on the sensitive plate of the
mind? To do this it would be necessary
to compress all past time and all future
time into one moment, and all matter into
one single square inch or square yard of
space, so that the impression of it could be
made. To believe in the indestructibility
of matter, with Mr. Spencer’s theory of the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_179"></a>[179]</span>
mind’s capacity to know, is delirium and
insanity. It is to believe in something
that the mind, by its very nature, cannot
even get an impression of. It is believing
that the ocean can be carried in a thimble
without any bottom. Any man who should
utter this publicly, and sincerely, would be
put in the insane asylum. He says again,
“the very nature of the intelligence negatives
the supposition that motion can be
conceived (much less known) either to
commence or to cease.” The nature of the
intelligence is such that all the knowledge
it possesses is made up of sensations and
manifestations of the unknown. How can
the continuity of motion be conceived? To
do this, we must have a conception of all
past time and all future time. It is an
idea as transcendent as the idea of God.</p>

<p>Mr. Spencer claims that the power the
universe manifests to us is utterly inscrutable;
that space and time are wholly<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_180"></a>[180]</span>
incomprehensible; that matter, in its ultimate
nature, is as absolutely incomprehensible
as space and time; that all efforts to
understand the essential nature of motion
do but bring us to alternative absurdities
of thought; that it is impossible to form
any idea of force in itself, and equally
impossible to comprehend either its mode
of exercise or its law of variation; that we
are unable to believe or to conceive that
the duration of consciousness is infinite,
and equally unable to know it as finite, or
to conceive it as finite; and that the personality
of which we are each conscious, and
of which the existence is to each a fact
beyond all others the most certain, yet is a
thing which cannot truthfully be known
at all: knowledge of it is forbidden by
the very nature of thought. All this is
perfectly consistent with his theory of
knowledge. This is the point to which
David Hume, his master, conducted the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_181"></a>[181]</span>
human mind in its search for truth. But
Spencer is not logical; he had a theory
of being that contradicted his theory of
knowing. So he reasons first one way and
then another. He says, elsewhere in his
First Principles, that common sense asserts
the existence of a reality; that objective
science proves that this reality cannot be
what we think it; that subjective science
shows why we cannot think of it as it is,
and yet are compelled to think of it as
existing; and that in this assertion of a
reality utterly inscrutable in nature, religion
finds an assertion essentially coinciding
with her own. That we are compelled to
regard every phenomenon as a manifestation
of some power by which we are
acted upon. That though omnipresence is
unthinkable, yet as experience discloses no
bounds to the diffusion of phenomena, we
are unable to think of limits to the
presence of this power, while the criticisms<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_182"></a>[182]</span>
of science teach us that this power is
incomprehensible. Analyzing the above
declarations, we find that Mr. Spencer
knows there is an ultimate reality. Then
it has being. It acts upon us. Then it
has the attribute of action. All phenomena
are manifestations of it. Then it
has power. All phenomena are manifestations
of an inscrutable power, by which
we are acted upon. Then it has causal
energy. We are unable to think of limits
to the presence of this power. Then it is
omnipresent. So the unknowable, inscrutable
something has being, power, activity,
causal energy, and omnipresence. But
how are we to grasp these universal,
transcendental attributes of the unknowable,
with an intelligence incapable of
receiving anything but simple, separate,
unrelated, broken impressions and manifestations?
It takes as much mind to believe
in the unknowable, with the attributes of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_183"></a>[183]</span>
power, activity, being, causal energy, and
omnipresence, as to believe in a self-existent
God, with the attributes of power,
wisdom, justice, truth, and love.</p>

<p>Spencer’s theory of knowing is destructive,
while his theory of being is constructive
and transcendental.</p>

<h3>VIII.</h3>

<p>The intelligence, as the organ of truth,
must be large enough to find truth and
contain truth. No sane man would undertake
to dig down a mountain with a toothpick.
Mr. Spencer devoted page after page
to the discussion of cause, time, space, force,
and ultimate reality, while holding a theory
of knowledge that made the very thought
of these inconceivable. The very things
that he labeled as knowable contained a
substrate the mind could never get at.
Knowable things, then, could not be known
as they were; hence if they were known at<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_184"></a>[184]</span>
all, must be known as they were not, which
made the mind’s knowledge error. All
who accept Mr. Spencer’s theory of knowledge
are shut up to absolute ignorance or
absolute error. If we are to know the truth
of reality, of mind, of external existence, we
must have knowing faculties up to the style
of the truth we are to know. If we are
to know light, we must have eyes capable
of taking in the light, of analyzing it, and
turning it into vision. The disposition to
limit our power to know, by telling us, on
the strength of Mansel and Hamilton and
Kant, that all our knowledge is relative, is
innocent enough when stripped of its seeming
wisdom. It is true that we can know no
more than our knowing faculties permit us.</p>

<p>We cannot know more than we can know.
We are not absolute and omniscient as to
our capacity to know. All we can see is
what we can see with our eyes. We cannot
see with our fingers or with the back<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_185"></a>[185]</span>
of our heads. All we can hear is what we
can hear with our ears. We have no other
organs with which to hear. All sounds
that vibrate at the rate of sixteen times
to the second up to thirty-eight thousand
times to the second, we can hear. Whatsoever
sounds vibrate at a lower rate than
sixteen times to the second or at a higher
rate than thirty-eight thousand times to the
second, we cannot hear, because such sounds
are not related to the ear. But the eye,
being adjusted to and related to much finer
wave lengths than the ear, can see waves
that vibrate up as high as seven hundred
and twenty-seven trillion times to the second.
The eye cannot see waves shorter
than seven hundred and twenty-seven
trillion vibrations to the second, because
such waves are not adjusted to the eye.
The waves the ear cannot hear are not
sound waves. The waves the eye cannot
see are not light waves. There are no<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_186"></a>[186]</span>
sound waves in the universe the ear cannot
hear, provided they are near enough to come
into contact with it. There are no light
waves in the universe that the eye cannot
turn into vision, if they strike the retina.
Are we going to fall out with the eye, and
discredit the beauty it does see, because it
is not as large as the rim of immensity, and
cannot see everything disclosed by the light
of suns and stars at once? Are we to hold
the ear in contempt after it takes in the
harmonies of Beethoven and Mozart, because
it cannot hear all the music the stars
are making as they move through the
heavens?</p>

<p>Whatever is real and true the mind can
know, because the mind is correlated to
the real and the true. It cannot know
what is unreal and untrue. It cannot
know that two and two make five, because
that is unreal and untrue. It cannot know
that a crooked line is the shortest distance<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_187"></a>[187]</span>
between two points, because that is unknowable.
It cannot know that it is more
rational to tell a lie than to tell the truth,
because that is unknowable and untrue.
There is much that is unknowable, but
whatever is, we may be sure is irrational
and unreal. Whatever is true in being,
cause, time, space, mind, matter, force, motion
may be known. The finite mind cannot
know it at once, and can never,
throughout all infinite time, directly take it
into the intelligence; but it is knowable,
because the underlying, fundamental, prior
thing in the universe is mind, the mind
of the absolute and eternal One. All
things are set in order and reason. The
external universe is the expression of mind,
and is therefore intelligible. The human
intelligence is the expression of the same
mind, and is therefore capable of grasping
and turning into thought the intelligible
order without.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_188"></a>[188]</span></p>

<p>According to the theory of Locke, Berkeley,
Hume, Mill, and Spencer, any knowledge
whatsoever is impossible. If the
knowing subject and the knowable object,
the two factors of knowledge, can only
come together in a mechanical way, as
basket and potatoes, kettle and water,
paper and letters, then the very conditions
of knowledge are denied, and we are shut
up to blank, square ignorance.</p>

<p>Things come together to form knowledge,
as things come together to form a
tree, and not as house, calico, pins, lace,
shoes, and blankets come together to form
a store. An acorn is a living something.
It is not a tree, but within itself are the
germs of a tree. When grown, it may be
said to have forms, as root, trunk, and
branches. These were potentially and
ideally contained in the acorn. But their
realization and active expression involved
a process, in which the ideal forms, tendencies,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_189"></a>[189]</span>
and forces contained in germ in the
acorn met and united with the elements of
the outside world. Suppose we consider
the acorn the subject, and the particles in
soil and rain and atmosphere capable of
making a tree as the object. What happens
when an oak with all its beauty
stands out upon the hillside? This subject
and object have come together in
unity, in an organism. Suppose Locke
should have undertaken the work of understanding
how a tree came to be, instead
of how knowledge came to be. We will
say he began by analyzing a full grown
tree. After thorough examination of its
contents, he finds that all the parts of the
tree, carbon, water, etc., are found outside
of it in the external world.</p>

<p>He finds that the tree is composed of
various atoms, all of which may be found
in the soil and in the atmosphere. He
concludes, then, that these atoms from soil<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_190"></a>[190]</span>
and atmosphere, began to move up to and
down to the acorn. The acorn, passive
meanwhile, lets them fall on it. So, of
their own free will and accord, the atoms
kept piling themselves upon the acorn, until
in the process of a hundred years there
was a tree. Now a brick column might be
carried up after this fashion, but not a tree.
The prior and fundamental thing in an oak
tree is the acorn. It contains an active,
organizing life principle. Falling into the
soil, this folded life power begins to stir.
It lays hold upon the elements about it,
digests them, assimilates them, and turns
them into an oak. The mind is to the raw
material of knowledge, what the acorn is
to the raw material of oak. Through the
senses the raw material is conveyed into the
mind. It is then appropriated, assimilated,
digested, and turned into knowledge. The
active, organizing, combining power that
turns the raw material presented by the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_191"></a>[191]</span>
senses into knowledge, does not come from
the outside world. It is constitutional, fundamental,
original. Just as the organic
forces of the plant take up the elements
from the outside environment upon which
it subsists, so the synthesizing, living power
of the mind takes the matter of sensation
and turns it into the whole called knowledge.
Knowledge is a unifying process.
It combines the manifold into one. It reduces
multiplicity to unity. All that is
real and all that is true in the heavens
above or in the earth below, in mind or in
matter, in time or in space, in man or in external
world, are capable of being reduced
to unity in knowledge.</p>

<p>Knowledge is the subjective unity in the
finite mind that corresponds to the objective
unity that lies within the infinite mind.
Nothing less than a universal synthesis
satisfies the finite mind, because it is a
copy of the infinite mind. The finite<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_192"></a>[192]</span>
self-consciousness is a copy of the infinite self-consciousness.
The infinite mind knows
all things at once; the finite mind comes to
knowledge through a gradual process. It
can never, through all eternity, know all
the infinite mind knows, but it can eternally
advance in knowledge, and comfort
itself at every stage of the process with the
thought that nothing in the mind of the
infinite and absolute one is foreign to it, or
in contradiction with its capacity to know.
In thinking, the finite mind is at home in
its father’s realm, and because this realm
stretches out illimitably every way should
not oppress us or discourage us. For this
the finite mind can know, that throughout
the limitless domain of God there is order
and truth and reality.</p>

<p>Thus standing face to face with truth,
and being endowed with intellectual capacities
capable of recognizing it, grasping it,
in its unity and in its particulars, it is<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_193"></a>[193]</span>
proper to inquire the object and the purpose
of it. It is the revelation which the
infinite mind has made to the finite. It is
the language of God, in which he has embodied
his thought. It is the word of the
universal spirit. Man is a spirit, and he is
to grow and come to the full realization of
himself by partaking of the word of God.
Truth has been revealed for no other purpose
than to make men. Sir William Hamilton
represents truth as game, and the
method of getting truth to a chase. He says
the exercise of our powers involved in the
process of getting truth is better than the
game we seek. Lessings says, “If the Almighty,
holding in one hand truth, and in
the other search after truth, presented them
to me and asked me which I would choose,
with all humility, but without hesitation, I
should say, give me search after truth.”</p>

<p>Mallbranche says: “If I held truth captive,
like a bird in my hand, I would let it<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_194"></a>[194]</span>
go again, that I might chase and capture
it.” Müller says: “Truth is the property
of God alone. Search after truth belongs
to man.” Such sentiments indicate that
the men who uttered them had no correct
idea of the real nature of truth, or of man’s
intellectual nature, the necessary food of
which is truth. It is true that the search
after truth gives exercise and pleasure to
the intellectual faculties, as search after
bread gives exercise and health to the
physical powers. But an eternal search
for bread is not sufficient to keep man’s
body robust and strong. The very condition
upon which he will be able to keep
up the search for it is, that he regularly and
steadily partake of it. A tree, had it intelligence
and emotion, would, doubtless,
enjoy wrestling with the storms, and throwing
its roots into the earth and its branches
into the heavens, making levies upon earth
and sky for its own nourishment; but if it<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_195"></a>[195]</span>
did not constantly turn the elements it
found into its trunk and branches, it would
not be able to wrestle long with the
storms, or forage long upon the earth and
sky.</p>

<p>To claim that the intellectual faculties
are always to search for truth, and that the
search is better than the truth, is tacitly to
assume that truth is not for them; or, if for
them, and should ever be found, would be
as useless as a poor, tired, half-dead fox
overtaken by the hunters in the chase.
Searching for truth is doing; partaking of
truth is being. The search gives agility
and skill; the partaking of truth gives
wealth of character. To hunt game with
no other object than that which comes from
the sport of the chase is degrading. To
shoot birds only for the purpose of seeing
them fall is mean and wicked. So, to
search for truth with no other purpose than
that which comes from the exercise of the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_196"></a>[196]</span>
search, is unworthy the intellect that was
given, not only to find truth, but to grow
rich and God-like by partaking of the truth.</p>

<p>Man’s need for bread, we saw, led to the
establishment of commerce, and commerce
did far more than secure to man food and
clothing and shelter. It brought men together
and discovered themselves to themselves.
Power lent itself to the uses of
man’s social nature, awakened and developed
by commerce, and made it possible
for men to come into relations with one
another, not simply in states and nations,
but on all the earth. The need for bread
helped to the formation of society, the
nature of power and the applications to
which it lent itself widened the social domain
into a universal brotherhood, to which
man, as a spirit, was correlated. But many
saw bread only in its relations to hunger,
and power only in its relations to wealth
and worldly dominion. So, many see in<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_197"></a>[197]</span>
truth no purpose except the practical and
material ends to which it can be put. In
the esteem of the utilitarians, it was well
enough that learned men consecrated their
genius and their industry to the study of
the subtle subject of heat. It was well
that they discovered the real nature of heat,
and saw that it was not caloric, but a mode
of motion. Because this opened the way
for our railroads and steamboats and quick
methods of transportation, which have contributed
so much to the world’s wealth.
It was well that the impracticable and
theoretical men, who had nothing better to
do, spent ages studying the nature of electricity,
and finally discovered that there
were certain metals for which it had affinity,
and that it had speed equal to thought
itself. For these studies have enabled the
practical and substantial men to order their
corn and meat by telegraph, and the practical
housewives to order their roast beef<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_198"></a>[198]</span>
by telephone. It is well that people who
had no practical turn of mind spent years
in considering the structure of the human
frame, and the plants and minerals capable
of ministering to it, for in this way the
doctors have got ideas by which they are
enabled to keep us practical men alive, so
that we can trade longer, and build more
factories and eat more victuals.</p>

<p>Now it is true that the knowledge the
intelligence comes to by insight into the
relations and nature and truth of things,
can be turned to practical account. But
the truth the mind finds by study was not
primarily intended to open the way for
steam cars and telegraphs and the production
of wealth. These things are incidental.
Truth is the provision God has
made for the intellect. The knowledge
of the stars has helped man to sail the sea
and to take his bearings on any part of its
surface. But the practical account to<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_199"></a>[199]</span>
which this knowledge has been turned is
not to be compared, in value, to the effect
it was intended to have on the human
mind, strengthening it, ennobling it, and
harmonizing it with the divine mind.</p>

<span class="smaller">THE PROVISION FOR THE MORAL NATURE OF MAN.</span></h2>

</div>

<p>Two elements are essential to the process
of thinking, the intellect and the
truth. One is within, the other is without.
The one is subjective, the other is
objective. Two elements are also essential
to the process of volition, the will and the
right. The one within, the other without.
The one subjective, the other objective.
Before sight is possible, there must
be an eye and there must be light. The
one is within, the other is without. The
one is subjective, the other is objective.
Before hearing, there must be an ear and
there must be sound. The one is within,
the other is without. The one is subjective,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_204"></a>[204]</span>
the other is objective. Before breathing
there must be lungs and there must be
atmosphere. The one is within, the other
is without. The one is subjective, the
other is objective.</p>

<p>No definition of man is large enough to
accommodate the facts of his nature, that
does not embrace what he is without as
well as what he is within, what he is objectively
as well as what he is subjectively.
It must not only embrace the intellect, but
the truth which it thinks; not only the
will, but the right which corresponds to it;
not only the eye, but the light which
gives it meaning; not only the ear, but the
sound which matches it; not only the
lungs, but the atmosphere to which they
are correlated. Human nature is dually
constituted, so that the larger half of itself
is outside of itself.</p>

<p>Illustrations of the same duality of constitution
may be found on a limited scale<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_205"></a>[205]</span>
in the organic and in the inorganic worlds.
The greater half of the oak is not in the
life germ of the acorn, but in the elements
of the soil and the sky which environ it.
The larger part of the fish is in the ocean
which surrounds it. Most of the fuel
which makes the heat in the grate is not
in the carbon of the coal, but in the
oxygen of the air which fills the room.</p>

<h3>I.</h3>

<p>The possession of a will and the capacity
for choice make man a moral being.
Man’s will is bounded on every side by
the laws of God. These laws are only
another name for God’s will. Man is
made in God’s image and has a will, as far
as it goes, just like God’s will.</p>

<p>By choosing to act and to move along
the lines of law which gather from every
whither about his will, he finds he can go
somewhere, that he can leave the narrow,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_206"></a>[206]</span>
provincial, and local neighborhood of ease
and sense and subjection, and find his life
in that broad realm of freedom, that belongs
to him as a thinking and willing
being.</p>

<p>At the termini of some railroads there
are huge contrivances called turntables.
They are constructed of immense timbers
and balanced on pivots. They are large
enough to accommodate the full length of
a steam engine. Iron rails are laid across
these tables, of the same size and the same
distance apart as the rails which make up
the lines of the main track. When the
train comes in from the far interior, the
engine is run out on one of these tables
and turned round, so that the headlight
faces the main track again. Before the
engine is ready to leave the short track,
however, the rails on the turntable must
exactly correspond to the rails on the
main road. Then the engineer pulls the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_207"></a>[207]</span>
throttle, and the great locomotive rolls
past the circumference of its pivoted and
temporary resting place into commerce
with the railways of the globe. Imagine
railway lines coming together about
such a revolving table from all the earth,
so that an engine could pass from this
circular platform toward any quarter of
the globe, the only condition being that
the short track on the table correspond
to the rails of the long track on which it
was proposed for the engine to run, and
you have an illustration, which in some degree
helps us to understand the relation of
man’s will to the laws of God.</p>

<p>Should the engineer undertake to get
the engine from the table without reference
to the lines upon which it was intended
to run, we know very well what
the consequences would be. He would
not go far, and even the little distance he
should manage to make would be attended<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_208"></a>[208]</span>
with tremendous bumping and friction.
All movement would be in the direction
of chaos and confusion. However great
the expenditure of energy, no point would
be reached, and the end of the undertaking
would be waste and failure. If, on the
other hand, we should imagine an engine
on such a revolving plane, capable of making
fifty miles an hour, with no tracks
leaving it, we know it could not go anywhere,
and besides there would be no reason
for its being. It would be without
meaning. Before the distance between
one point and another can be passed by a
train, two things are necessary, an engine
and a railroad. The one may be called
subjective, the other objective. The one
implies the other. They are the necessary
elements of transportation. As long as the
train keeps to the iron rails laid for it, it
moves without friction. It is only when
the subjective element jumps the track<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_209"></a>[209]</span>
and essays to determine its own objective
direction, that trouble comes. Then it is
that cars are ditched and people killed or
crippled. The laws of God run to and fro
throughout the whole earth. They cross
and recross every realm. They pass
through every domain, physical, mental,
and moral. They go straight through
matter and straight through mind. They
lead under the sea and over the sea and
through the sea. Down through the earth
and up through the air they may be noted,
embracing with their invisible tracks every
square inch of soil and sky. They insure
the order of the universe, visible and invisible,
tangible and intangible. They reach
from globe to globe and make possible the
commerce of the spheres. They run out
into the infinitely great and back into the
infinitely small, and bind in unity the
atoms and the stars.</p>

<p>When man, by the aid of his reason,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_210"></a>[210]</span>
discovers the truth of things, which is the
provision for his intellect, these laws appear
as provision for his will.</p>

<p>So truth and law, reality and righteousness,
expressions of the thought and will
of God, are the everlasting facts to which
man is to adjust his intellect and will, if
he is to cross the oceans, travel the continents,
and claim the possessions which in
the universe belong to him. If he misreads
the facts, he will of course misread
the laws which govern the facts, and will
thus be unable to get facts or laws to serve
him. But clearly seeing the truth of
things, he is able to avail himself of the
laws of things. As long as he only saw
things in the lump, and looked upon the
world as so much air and earth and fire
and water, he missed the subtle laws
which regulate the atomic and molecular
structure of bodies, and failed to make
them his servants. When, by the aid of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_211"></a>[211]</span>
observation and experiment, he reduced
the earth to its ultimate particles and came
to such knowledge of it as corresponded to
the facts of it; when he came to see the
laws and drift of things, the tendencies
and affinities of things; he had only to put
the productions of his will in line with the
way things were going, to have them
serve him. Seeing that forces have power
to do work in proportion to their energy
of position, and applying this insight to
the river with forty feet fall, he builds his
mill beside it and thus utilizes it to grind
his wheat. Seeing what soil and sunlight
and rain can do when they combine to unwrap
the life in a seed, he commits his
wheat to their benevolent tendencies and
gets a harvest of twenty bushels for every
one he seems to lose. He studies fire.
He sees it wrap in flame and level in
an hour fortunes it took a lifetime to accumulate.
He learns what a furious and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_212"></a>[212]</span>
awful force it is. He gets insight into its
real nature. He gets knowledge of it that
corresponds to the reality of it. He sees
that it is only a flaming and lurid method
of movement. With the truth of it he
gets the law of it. So by the aid of volition,
put forth in accordance with intelligence,
he contrives a machine corresponding
to the laws of heat, as a mode of motion.
In this way he utilizes the heat that
burned up his cities, to transport him in
ease and comfort over the country. He
studies the stars until his knowledge of
them corresponds to them as they are;
along with this knowledge, he comes to an
understanding of their laws, their uniform
methods of action. Then he builds his
great ships and commits them to the wild
and storm-tossed sea, sure that his power
to guide them will never fail as long as
law and order remain in the heavens.</p>

<p>That there is a natural order, with certain<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_213"></a>[213]</span>
inhering laws, men readily accept.
That this order has the consistency of being
developed in one way; that there is a dip
to things that must be followed; that there
is a clew, in accordance with which things
may be worked; that there is a trend, drift,
and law of things that must be accepted
and followed; all this, men readily assent
to. They do not attempt to farm the Sahara
Desert, for they know the conditions
of harvests are not there. They do not
put out orange groves in Minnesota, nor
plant cotton in Canada, nor sow rice in
British Columbia. They do not expect
the soil that spews up the ice to produce
watermelons at the same time. They do
not pretend to navigate ships over the continents,
and to lay their railway lines on
the surface of the sea. They fix their telegraph
wires to poles by means of little
glass contrivances, and never attempt to
send electricity through the grape vine.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_214"></a>[214]</span>
Natural laws they know inhere in the facts
of nature, and are not read into earth and
rock and river and atmosphere. They
know that necessary laws reside in the
facts of condition, and that they must study
these laws to know the line of practical
work they require. In building a house of
stone they know it is necessary to defer to
the law of gravity, that this law cannot be
ignored or set aside, so they carry up the
edifice in such conformity to rule and line
as that the center of gravity falls in a line
inside the base. They might prefer a house
built with reference to a different order of
things, one in which the center of gravity
would fall in a line outside the base. But
it is very well understood among men that
the law of gravity must be respected. Even
anarchists and nihilists, who seem to have
irrepressible antipathy for all ancient orders
and laws and establishments, do condescend
sufficiently to respect the time-honored,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_215"></a>[215]</span>
even if slightly belated, laws of
gravity.</p>

<h3>II.</h3>

<p>The time was when men accepted the
existence of a moral order with the same
implicit, unquestioned confidence, that all
men to-day accept the existence of a natural
order. In Homer’s Themistes we have
an illustration of this confidence. The
very word by which the decision of a judge
is described attributes it to Themis, the invisible
embodiment of justice. Thus the
judge is but the channel through which the
decision passes from the unseen moral order
into the Greek court of justice. The judge
is not respected because he has authority
to make the decision, but because his vocation
makes him the vehicle through which
the decision of a higher power is rendered.
Moses said to the people of Israel, “Thou
shalt not lie,” “Thou shalt not steal,”
“Thou shalt not commit adultery,” but<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_216"></a>[216]</span>
these were not his words simply, but the
words through which a moral order was
interpreted. The solemn and awful import
given to these commands did not arise
from the vehicle through which they
passed into the Hebrew social order, but
from the fact that they inhered in the very
constitution of man as a social being, and
when they were uttered, they were felt to
come from the God who fashioned man’s
life and set him in communities and states.
They had the same sort of authority in the
moral realm that the declarations of Newton,
concerning the power of gravity, had
in the natural. Newton did not conceive
in his own brain the laws of gravity, he
saw them and formulated them. Nor did
Moses create the Ten Commandments, he
saw them and interpreted them. The laws
of gravity were transcripts from the will of
God concerning matter, the Ten Commandments
were transcripts from the will of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_217"></a>[217]</span>
God concerning men. When natural
bodies come together, it would be found
that they always attracted each other in
proportion to their mass and inversely as
the squares of their distance. When men
come together, it would always be found,
that if they were to live together in harmony
and health; if they were to advance
and get above the planes of the brutes and
the savages; they must abstain from lying,
and stealing, and adultery, and thus be
truthful, and honest, and virtuous.</p>

<p>The laws of gravity were not arbitrary
rules, ordained to oppress suns and systems
without rhyme or reason. Order of some
sort had to be preserved among the
millions of blazing, rolling worlds. Nor
were the Ten Commandments arbitrary
lines of conduct imposed upon men at the
pleasure of a great, omnipotent tyrant.
Men could not live apart, out of touch
and contact with one another. Thus living,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_218"></a>[218]</span>
they were lower than the beasts that
perish. They could not live together
without rules of some sort to regulate
their lives. And laws which looked to
the preservation of truthfulness, honesty,
and virtue, were thought better than laws
which looked to the production of lying,
dishonesty, and adultery.</p>

<p>Because of the impetus given to the
studies of material science within recent
years, by the discoveries of scholars, the
attention of men has been directed to the
objects of the natural world and the laws
which regulate them. Discoveries into
the nature of heat, light, etc., has had the
same effect upon the human mind that the
discoveries of the gold fields in the West
had upon the people of America in the
early days. People abandoned fields and
shops and stores and went in search for
gold. The attention of the civilized world
has in this generation been directed to the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_219"></a>[219]</span>
consideration of outward facts. There
has been promise here of earthly fortune.
Conviction as to the existence of a moral
order with its rewards and penalties is not
so deep and abiding as it once was among
English speaking people. But it is well
to remember that the moral laws of the
universe have not in the meantime been
suspended, because men have not seen
proper to consider them and to act with
reference to them. They are just as real
and as unfailing as ever. When accepted
and followed, their presence is seen in
health, in political stability, in intellectual
progress. When ignored and forgotten,
their presence is seen in disease, in political
corruption, in mental stupidity, in
sham and emptiness. In one way or another
they always manage to get in their
work. They never sleep, they never tire,
they are eternally present to bless or to
curse, to lift up or to cast down. They<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_220"></a>[220]</span>
get round to every man’s home, and sooner
or later to every man’s life, bearing honor
or dishonor, legitimate reward or righteous
infamy. They are not to be bribed, whitewashed,
or bulldozed; they come clean, unvarnished,
and unveneered to posit their
labels on every man’s character; and whatever
is read on the label, absolutely defines
the content. Irrespective of money, titles,
place, or rank, they come. The president
in his seat, the judge on his bench, the
preacher in his pulpit, cannot escape. If
the president gets labeled pigmy, pigmy
he is. If the judge gets classified fraud,
fraud he is. If the preacher gets down as
trimmer and sham, trimmer and sham
he is.</p>

<h3>III.</h3>

<p>How are we to find moral laws? Just as
we find natural laws. When we find the
truth of natural bodies, reason sees the laws
which inhere in them, and prudence dictates<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_221"></a>[221]</span>
such action on our part as these laws
require. When we come to truth, on the
moral plane, or to such knowledge of the
facts as corresponds to the truth, reason,
unless perverted, sees the laws that reside
in them, and conscience dictates that these
laws should be obeyed. Conscience unerringly
and infallibly approves the right.
By the aid of the light which is thrown upon
it when the intellect comes into relations
of knowledge with moral truth, it recognizes
the laws the will ought to follow.
These laws make up a part of the truth.
Before the right can be recognized, the truth
must be seen. When that which the intelligence
takes for truth is not the truth, the
conscience will recognize laws for the will
to follow that do not correspond to the laws
of God. It has often happened that what
the intelligence took for truth did not correspond
to objective reality, and hence was
not the truth; hence the conscience has often<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_222"></a>[222]</span>
approved and suggested lines of action that
were at variance with that which was essentially
and eternally right. Those who followed
the dictates of conscience, however,
under such conditions, did, under the circumstances,
right. To have refused to follow
conscience would have increased their
confusion. A man in the bog, with the certainty
of death before him, ought to follow
the guide that appears, even though he
should not know how to lead him out of
the swamp. Conscience never fails to come
as near recognizing the right as the intellect
comes to discovering the truth. When
that which the intellect apprehends as truth
corresponds to objective reality, we may be
sure that the laws which inhere in it, and
which conscience suggests as the ones the
will ought to follow, correspond to the laws
of God. One’s conscience may lead him
wrong, but only when the intellect has led
him wrong. St. Paul’s conscience led him<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_223"></a>[223]</span>
wrong when it impelled him to persecute
the Christians of the early church, but it
was because that which he held for truth
did not tally with the outward facts, and
hence was not the truth. Had the supposed
truth which he held while persecuting the
Christians been real truth, then in persecuting
the Christians he would have done
right. The reversal of conscience resulted
from the incoming of new truth, or such
knowledge as was sustained by the outward
facts. The conscience of the Hindoo
mother that leads her to throw her child
into the River Ganges is as good as the conscience
of the Christian mother that leads
her to carry her child to the Sunday school.
The trouble with the Hindoo mother is not
with her conscience, but with her religious
knowledge; it does not correspond to the
facts of the order of the moral and spiritual
universe. We are to determine the value
of the affirmations of conscience by determining<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_224"></a>[224]</span>
the value of the knowledge out of
which those affirmations grow. Knowledge
is valuable in proportion to its correspondence
with that which is real. As
often as the intellect grasps the truth, the
conscience will suggest the right that accompanies
it. There is no truth of a moral
nature that has not its attendant right.</p>

<h3>IV.</h3>

<p>We know the moral truth as we know
material truth, through its relations. Relation
makes the difference between chaos
and cosmos. To define any natural object
is to place it in its relations. We could not
define oxygen without naming the elements
to which it is related. To take it out of
relation is to take from it any meaning.
Error is wrong relation. When the mind
assigns a place to an object other than
that which really belongs to it, in the order
of which it forms a part, we call this error.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_225"></a>[225]</span>
If, seeing the parts of a house scattered over
a field by a storm, we should confound a
sleeper with a rafter, we should take it from
its proper place and take away its meaning
as a part of the building. All of our
knowledge is of relations and not of sensations,
as Hume taught. Sensations set
the mind to classifying and comparing, and
the knowledge it comes to is of relations.
Take the sensations the mind has when a
red object is presented to the eye. Does
not the mind begin at once to distinguish
this sensation as one of redness
from other sensations that are of different
colors?</p>

<p>Is not its reality as a particular color
constituted for us by its relation to colors,
by its place in the scale of colors? If there
was but one color, and that color the one
we now know as red, how could we know
it as such? How could we call it red unless
to distinguish it from some other color with<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_226"></a>[226]</span>
which we, for the time being, compared it
or contrasted it? So true is it that reality
is constituted for us by the sum of its relations,
that if the relations of things are maintained,
no increase or diminution of the quantity
of things related will be detected in our
knowledge of them. If the earth were
compressed into a sphere no larger than a
marble, no one could know it if the relations
among the objects which make it up were
the same.</p>

<p>Again, the earth might be enlarged
until it should be a billion times larger
than what it is; yet this could not be
known as long as men and gates and spoons
and saucers and houses and cuff-buttons
were enlarged in the same proportion. The
leaf of a man’s dining table might be ten
miles square, and the ball of butter on his
table as big as the Stone Mountain in
Georgia; yet if cook, and cat, and stove,
and water-bucket were increased in the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_227"></a>[227]</span>
same ratio, he would not recognize any
difference.</p>

<h3>V.</h3>

<p>We enter the world of humanity, which
is the realm of morality, through the
family. Here we open our eyes to the
light, and here we have the first intimations
of truth, which is provision for the
intellect, and of righteousness, which is
provision for the will. The truth of the
family is the sum of the relations which
subsist among the members of it. The
family consists, we will say, of father and
mother, and children. Here is a man and
a woman, then, bound together by the
relation of marriage. The children are
related to the parents as offspring. The
children are related to one another as
brothers and sisters. Altogether they are
one and they are many. There is unity
and there is difference. In the relations
implied in the names husband and wife,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_228"></a>[228]</span>
father and mother, parents and children,
brothers and sisters, we have the truth of
the family. We know the family and can
only know the family through these relations.
Take the relations away, and you
take the family away. There cannot be a
husband without a wife, a father without
a mother, parents without children, and
children without a father and a mother.
Abiding in these relations, which make up
the truth of the family, wrapt up with
them and growing out of them, are the
laws of right which the will is to obey.
The relation of marriage is accompanied
by certain obligations and duties which
husband and wife are to observe. These
obligations and duties are divine laws,
because marriage is a divine relation. The
relations involved in the term parents, are
attended by certain necessary laws the
father and the mother are to observe with
reference to children. The names of child,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_229"></a>[229]</span>
brother, sister, imply relations that in turn
imply laws the child is to follow with reference
to parents, and brothers and sisters
are to regard with reference to one another.
These laws, which grow out of
the relations which constitute the family,
are not arbitrary, artificial, or accidental.
They have not been formed by the
opinions of men, nor formulated in the
legislative assemblies of men. Legislative
bodies have, perhaps, confirmed them and
reproduced them in statutes, but this was
not to create, but to transcribe what was
already present. The laws with reference
to which the members of a family find
themselves placed are as essential and constitutional
as the laws governing natural
objects, which we define when we say
bodies attract each other in proportion to
their mass and inversely as the squares of
their distance. These are subtle and
invisible principles which cannot be read<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_230"></a>[230]</span>
out of rocks and logs and moons and suns.
Displace rocks and logs and suns and
moons, and the apparent power of these
laws would not be seen, but upon the
appearance of the natural objects, they
would be immediately grasped and dominated
by the power of the laws.</p>

<p>We pass from the family into the school.
Here again we find laws already laid for
the will to follow. They grow out of the
truth, constitutive of the school, and this
truth is made up of the relations subsisting
among the members of the school. There
are teachers, whose duty it is to control
and to instruct. There are children,
whose duty it is to learn and obey. The
school is an institution, the object of
which is to lead young minds into a knowledge
of the earth, its continents, seas,
rivers, and mountains; into a knowledge
of language, its structure, uses, and the
meaning of its terms; into a knowledge of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_231"></a>[231]</span>
humanity, its races, governments, and
religions. If children are to share in the
benefits of the object for which the school
is established, they must observe the laws
which inhere in the very constitution of it.</p>

<p>They must obey the teacher, they must
study the books, they must be polite, forbearing
and kind to one another. It often
happens that a child enters the school and
refuses to follow the laws that reside in
the structure and purpose of the school.
He is willful and conceited, and thinks his
own way better than the necessary and
essential way ordained for him. He has
the same sort of experience the engineer
has who attempts to run his engine from
the turntable, without reference to the
railway lines laid for it. There is friction
and trouble. Various methods of punishment
are resorted to with the view to get
his will to move along the lines laid for it.
If rebuke and punishment fail, then he is<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_232"></a>[232]</span>
turned out, to attempt the stupid and insane
experiment of getting himself through
the world without reference to the laws
fixed for his will to obey. Of course he
does not go far. He turns up sooner or
later in the jail, the hospital, the penitentiary,
or the poorhouse.</p>

<p>Leaving the school, we find ourselves
citizens of the state, members of society.
But we do not go into society like an ax-man
in a frontier forest to clear a place for
his house, his fence, and his field. Methods
of conduct are already prescribed, lines of
action are already fixed, and the laws which
claim our obedience are already formulated.
Society is an organism of mutually dependent
members; the object of it is the equity
of all, the welfare of all, and the liberty of
all. Equity, liberty, welfare do not come
by accident. Men cannot reach them out
of touch and contact with one another.
They are only possible to men living together,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_233"></a>[233]</span>
and only possible in conformity with
certain conditions, and in the observance of
certain laws. These laws lie folded in the
nature of men as social beings. They are
fundamental, and Aristotle saw them when
he said, “man is by nature a political
animal.” The germs of government and
law are in the depths of every man’s being,
as the germs of the oak are in the acorn.
Wise men, living in society, have seen the
truth of society, made up of the relations
subsisting among people living together.
Accompanying these relations, and counterparts
of them, they have discovered the
laws necessary to insure the equity, liberty,
and welfare of all. These laws have been
embodied in constitutions, enactments, and
statutes. To carry out these laws and to
make them prevail, certain institutions have
been established, a body of men whose
duty it is to execute the laws, a Judiciary,
whose duty it is to interpret and expound<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_234"></a>[234]</span>
the laws, and a legislative body, whose
duty it is to repeal old laws that did not
work well, and to frame new laws to meet
the exigencies of new conditions. To protect
the rights of all, certain penalties have
been made to accompany the violations of
laws. To make these penalties real, and
to inflict them upon the proper parties,
courts and jails and penitentiaries have
been established.</p>

<p>So we see, as the acorn cannot grow
without appropriating the elements already
prepared for it in the soil and the sky; and
as the carbon cannot burn without laying
hold of the oxygen already existing for it
in the atmosphere of the room; and as the
fish cannot swim without utilizing the
water already adjusted to its fins; so man
cannot fill out the possibilities of his being
without obeying the laws he finds already
ordained for his will, when he comes into
the world. These laws converge about<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_235"></a>[235]</span>
his will in the home where he first sees the
light, and are always deducible from the
particular relations in which, at any time,
his moral life is placed. They are as real
as the laws of heat and motion and gravity.
They run out from the home through the
school, and from the school through all the
continents of the social realm. They grow
out of the truth of the facts of the family,
the school, and society. They are as
fundamental, necessary, and divine as the
family, the school, and society. By observing
them, man is able to turn into his
character the tenderness of the home, the
learning of the school, and the resources of
society.</p>

<h3>VI.</h3>

<p>The authority of the laws which govern
society is not found in the fact that the
laws have been made by the will of the
majority, or the will of the minority, or by
the will of a king, or by the wills of any<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_236"></a>[236]</span>
or all of the people; but because they are
founded in the constitution of human nature.
The basis for the constitution of
human nature is the mind of God, who
created man in his own image. Social laws
have authority, then, because they are
consonant with the nature of man, and
have their source in the will of God.</p>

<p>It is easy to show, however, from the
records of history, that nations have often
lived under laws imposed upon them that
contradicted every principle of human
nature. Men were accustomed once to
find the laws of society as well as the
laws of nature, not from the study of men,
or from the study of the objects of nature,
but in the depths of their own imaginations.
In former times men met in convention
and council and determined by resolution
the shape of the earth and the sun’s method
of movement. They also subjected themselves
to the criticism of posterity by cutting<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_237"></a>[237]</span>
the heads of the people off who did
not agree with them. But it gradually
dawned on the human mind that to find
out for certain the shape of the earth it
might be well to devote a little study to
the earth itself. Thus it happened that
in the course of events men ceased to read
laws into God’s material universe from the
boundless realms of their fancy and conceit,
and fell upon the more rational habit of
taking the laws that were already there.
Herein is the difference between mediæval
and modern times.</p>

<p>The disposition to read laws into nature,
without reference to the facts of nature, was
in line with the programme to read laws
into the social realm without reference to
the facts of human nature. The laws of astronomy
to-day are such as have been found
by a study of the stars. The laws of chemistry
are such as have been found by a study
of the atomic structures of bodies. One<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_238"></a>[238]</span>
might fall out now with the celestial laws of
Ptolemy, and head a movement to set them
aside. But it is not rational to fall out
with the astronomical laws of Norman
Lockyer, for that is to buck against the
sun, and to make faces at the stars.
Lockyer’s laws came straight to him from
the skies, and find their value and verification
in the close calculation of every
steamer that sails on the wide, restless
sea. The laws of civilized nations to-day
are such as have been found by a study of
the facts of human nature. To quarrel
with them is to set one’s self against the
way man is built. It would not do to say
that the social laws of civilized peoples
to-day are exact transcripts from the will
of God concerning the conduct of social
life. Men do not now, and perhaps will
not for a long time, read aright the facts of
human nature. One thing is certain, however:
in the making of laws among civilized,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_239"></a>[239]</span>
republican peoples, reference is had to the
facts of human nature, and not to the
fancy of those who wish to govern. It
cannot be disputed that the right facts
are considered from which to make deductions.
This means a complete change
of front in the modern world over the ages
past. There are doubtless many minor
laws on the statute books of the liberal and
progressive nations of the earth to-day
which are not in accordance with the
nature of man; but it seems that any rational
person is compelled to admit that
the great legal trunk-lines conform to the
essential laws of human nature. Take the
Constitution of the United States. Some
one has said that the apple from which
Newton deduced the laws of gravity was
two thousand years falling. He would
have been nearer the truth if he had said
six thousand years. The Constitution of
the United States is as clearly a deduction<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_240"></a>[240]</span>
from the facts of human nature, as were
the laws of gravity from a study of falling
bodies. The convention that met in
Philadelphia to frame the Constitution of
the United States, in 1787, was called to
order on the top of the centuries. The
members had such advantage of position as
made it possible for them to look all down
the ages. They were in a position to see
all sides of human nature, under all forms
of government.</p>

<p>In the preamble to the Constitution, they
specified certain objects for which, in their
esteem, this government should be formed—union,
domestic tranquillity, justice,
liberty, welfare. Any government constituted
by a document like that has for the
basis of its existence the facts of human
nature, as really as the law of gravity has
for the basis of its existence the facts of
the stars.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_241"></a>[241]</span></p>

<h3>VII.</h3>

<p>If it is necessary that man grasp the
truth of things before he can determine the
laws of things, we cannot fail to see how
important it is that he have a proper theory
of knowledge.</p>

<p>Man’s idea of law will correspond to his
theory of knowledge. When the French
people accepted Locke’s theory of knowing
they immediately applied it to the laws,
establishments, and institutions of the nation.
They concluded logically, if all
knowledge is of sensations, then there can
be no authority for the belief in God, the
immortality of the soul, or the divinity of
law. These are universal and transcendent
facts, but the mind has no capacity to know
universal or transcendent facts. So society
was to be dissolved into its constituent
atoms, in order that individuals could arrange
their lives on a universal, go-as-you-please<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_242"></a>[242]</span>
principle. All existing laws and institutions
were to be obliterated. Everything
that was up was to be put down.
There are to-day, scattered through the
civilized states of Europe and in some parts
of the United States, men who want to
emancipate the people from the dominion
of all authority. All this grows out of the
fashionable and sensational theory of knowledge
taught first by John Locke and
David Hume, and within recent years by
John Stuart Mill and Herbert Spencer.
Here is the source of anarchy. There is
not an influential anarchist in the world,
but is one upon the basis of the physiological
theory of knowledge. There is no objective
reality, but such as is composed of
material atoms. These have got their arrangement
and collocations without the
agency of any great co-ordinating mind.
They come together in pairs and clusters
and groups, by the aid of no power but<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_243"></a>[243]</span>
such as issues from the unknowable. A
man is no more a criminal for killing
people than is the Mississippi River for
overflowing its banks and drowning people.
Men are mere products of nature, and their
thoughts are only secretions of the brain.
Laws and institutions are just the brain
deposits of animals we call men, as dams
across rivers and cells in gums are the deposits
of the brains of beavers and bees.</p>

<p>In a document found on the person of a
recent anarchist arrested by the authorities
in England, it is asserted that the purpose
of the anarchists is to put down all political,
religious, and military authority; to
burn all churches, palaces, soldier-barracks,
fortresses, provisions, and to destroy all
that has lived till now by business-work
without contributing to it. From such
documents we are to understand that the
anarchists take it for granted that all laws
and institutions among civilized peoples<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_244"></a>[244]</span>
have been imposed arbitrarily by those who
govern upon those who are governed; that
the parties to be governed have as much
right to ignore them as the governing
parties had to make them; that there is in
the universe no moral order to which the
political and social orders among men correspond;
that every man has the privilege
of setting up his own order; that every
engineer has the right to ignore the rails
laid for the flanges of his wheels on the
long roads leading out from the turntable,
and the inestimable subjective liberty of
pulling open the throttle valve and running
out into the country according to his
own sweet will. Suppose all the anarchists
in the world should be sent to some
great island so that they could test their
own theories, would they not be under the
necessity of founding some sort of a government?
They would have to construct
roads, devise ways and means for lights,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_245"></a>[245]</span>
water, and for protection against individual
violence. Would they not have to
bind themselves together by some kind of
social contract, or compact? If a number
of men should unite themselves into a syndicate
for the purpose of building houses
without reference to the laws of gravity, if
they should declare it as their set purpose
to so build houses as that the center of
gravity should fall in a line outside the
base, the whole company would be tried for
lunacy and confined in the insane asylum.
So the most summary and straightforward
methods should be adopted for ridding
society of all that class of men who
propose to manage human affairs without
reference to the facts of man’s nature
and the laws of the universe. It is
a question whether they should be put into
an insane asylum or into a jail, for it is
hard to determine which they have the most
of: insane stupidity or insane meanness.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_246"></a>[246]</span></p>

<p>Society has made great advances, but
every increment of progress has been along
the lines of the eternal laws of the universe.
Those laws were here before man appeared
upon the stage of action; they will be here
when he is gone. Men may doctor themselves
with error about truth, and error
about right, until they come to be great
imbeciles; but the truth and the right will
remain clear and immortal for the intellect
and the will of the wise and the good.</p>

<h3>VIII.</h3>

<p>It is important, as never before, for those
who see the truth and recognize the right
to declare the same with all authority. It
is said that the Emperor Henry IV. stood
shivering two whole days and nights in the
snows of the courtyard of Canossa Castle,
suing piteously for permission to throw
himself, in agonized submission, at the feet
of Hildebrand. That he was shunned by<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_247"></a>[247]</span>
his subjects more absolutely because of the
ban that was upon him than he would
have been had he been afflicted with the
smallpox. This incident illustrates for us
the authority wielded by the Church of
the Middle Ages. The Church was then
felt to be in touch with tremendous power.
Its fulminations carried terror to the hearts
of kings and subjects. What the Church
declared should be done, or should be left
undone, the people felt could only be disregarded
at the peril of all hope for time
and eternity. It not only declared the
duties men were under the necessity of observing
in order to save their souls, but the
kind of thoughts men were under the necessity
of thinking concerning the shape of
the earth, the movements of the stars, and
the structure of the human body, in order
to save themselves from the odium of
heresy. The Church reigned without a
rival in all the civilized world. She was<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_248"></a>[248]</span>
not expected to give any reason for her
actions or her utterances. When she determined
what the order of the solar system
was, the brains of men were compelled,
without question, to acquiesce. Even to
doubt was to deny the faith. The Church
dictated the policy of the stars without
being at the trouble of studying the stars;
and no other sidereal opinions were tolerated
but such as she formulated and published.</p>

<p>But the minds of scholars and students,
in different parts of Europe, began to reach
other conclusions concerning the nature and
order of things than such as had been ecclesiastically
settled for them. Copernicus
saw that the heavenly bodies did not move
in accordance with the teachings of the
Church. And when the Venetian scholars
looked through the telescope of Galileo at
Padua, and saw Jupiter and his satellites,
a central sun and revolving planets, the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_249"></a>[249]</span>
authority of the Church on the subject of
astronomy was gone. In this way the
Church has been forced to give up one
position after another. The people, seeing
she had no foundation for the opinions she
held concerning nature, began to question
the value of her opinions concerning God,
and heaven and hell, and right and wrong.</p>

<p>Now the Church must regain her note of
authority. She must do this by seeing
what the laws are which grow out of the
facts of condition. The laws of the family
are to be deduced from the truths of relation
which constitute the family. These
will be seen to coincide with the old laws
uttered from Sinai. The laws of society
are to be deduced from the truths of relation
which constitute society. These, it
will be seen, are summed up as was said of
old in the formula, “Thou shalt love thy
neighbor as thyself.” When men get
through framing laws for the regulation of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_250"></a>[250]</span>
human conduct, from a study of the facts
of human nature, they will find to their
amazement that they have reinstated the
Ten Commandments, and that Sinai is not
a burnt out volcano. They will find that
the Ten Commandments are still the foundations
of social health, and harmony, and
progress. God wrote them for Moses on
tables of stone because he had already
written them in the nature of man. The
laws of gravity can no more be read out of
the world of space than the Eternal Decalogue
can be read out of the world of
human life. So the man of law should
speak with the same authority as the man
of science, without apology and without
misgivings.</p>

<p>“If the endeavor to analyze the world is a trifle, it
is because the world is such. The sum of things can
have no second intention, nor can it be characterized
by any trait that is not included in itself. Some
things are sweet, but what is our sense which perceives
them; some things are good, but what is our conscience
which judges them; some things are true, but
what is our intellect which argues them; some things
are deep, but what is our reason which fathoms them?
Everyone who thinks deeply, must have reflected
that, if the purposes and results of man’s practice are
vanity, so also must be those of his speculation.
Goethe said, that there was no refuge from virtues
that were not our own, but in loving them; and Ecclesiastes,
that there was none from the vanity of
life, but in fearing and obeying God. So, also, from
the vanity of speculation there is no refuge but in
acquiescing in its relative nature, and accepting truth
for what it is.”</p>

<span class="smaller">THE PROVISION FOR THE ÆSTHETIC NATURE OF MAN.</span></h2>

</div>

<p>The glory of the mind is the possession
of two eyes, the eye of sense and the eye of
reason. Through the one, it looks out upon
the world of matter and fact. Through
the other, it beholds the world of idea and
relation. The world of matter and fact,
seen through the eye of sense, is lifted and
transfigured and multiplied a thousandfold
when contemplated through the eye of
reason. When the literal world is transferred
to the ideal world, it takes on hues
and dimensions in accordance with the universal
and illimitable nature of man. The
world which the sense sees, and the world
which the reason sees, are both real, and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_254"></a>[254]</span>
through the mind commerce is kept up
between them. Along this mental highway
facts make a pilgrimage to the holy
land of reason; there they are changed into
ideas. Stars are turned into astronomy,
atoms into chemistry, rocks into geology,
plants into botany, colors into beauty and
sounds into harmony.</p>

<p>Over the same royal road, ideas pass to
the world of sense. There they are changed
again into facts. Ideas of beauty, distilled
in the alembic of the imagination from the
seven prismatic colors, are turned into painting,
and Raphael’s “Transfiguration” blesses
the world. Ideas of harmony, formed
by the power of the imagination from the
notes of the musical scale, are turned into
song, and Handel’s “Messiah” agitates the
thoughts and feelings of men with the
melody of the skies. Ideas of form, deduced
from the contemplation of the shapes of
things, are turned into sculpture, and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_255"></a>[255]</span>
Michael Angelo’s “Moses” augments the
world’s fund of conviction and courage.
By changing facts into ideas, the mind gives
us science. By changing ideas back to
facts, it gives us art. Without science, life
would be without bread; without art, it
would be without ideals.</p>

<p>Science ministers to the body, art to the
spirit. Men who go from things to ideas
are practical; those who go from ideas back
to things are the seers. Practical men conserve,
but never venture. Seers throw the
light of their genius into the dark beyond,
disclosing new worlds for men. They are
the leaders, they are in the vanguard of
human progress.</p>

<p>By the possession of two eyes, the eye of
sense and the eye of reason, man is placed
into relation with two worlds.</p>

<p>The world he sees by the eye of sense is
meager, limited, poverty-stricken. There
are only a few houses in it, a little clump<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_256"></a>[256]</span>
of trees, a little patch of meadow, a horizon
hounded by the curl of his cabin smoke.
The world he sees by the eye of reason
stretches far down into the twilight of the
past, embracing all ages, all stages of progress,
all empires and republics, all literature
and peoples.</p>

<p>Through the eye of sense, he sees a world
of hard limitation and fact. Through the
eye of reason, a universe of ideas, visions,
relations. Through the eye of sense, he
sees a candle, with its flickering and passing
flame. Through the eye of reason, he sees a
kingdom of light, with truth and beauty,
and love billowing away to infinity.</p>

<p>Through the eye of sense he sees a little
mountain spring rise from the ground, to
lose itself in the deepening shadows of the
trees. Through the eye of reason he sees
a river, clear as crystal, flowing forever
from under the throne of God. A few
violets and buttercups, covering with their<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_257"></a>[257]</span>
blue and their beauty a little strip of
meadow, he sees through the eye of sense.
The hills of day, numberless and immeasurable,
covered with flowers, whose
leaves never wither and whose beauty never
fades, he sees through the eye of reason.</p>

<p>It is the conceit of those whose habit of
mind is to look through the eye of sense
alone, that they see more in the actual
tangible world than those who are accustomed
to look through the eye of reason
as well as through the eye of sense. There
never was a greater mistake. Those who
see most in the world of mountain and sea
and sky, are those who look most through
the eye of reason into the world of idea,
principle, and relation. Adams in England,
and Leverrier in France, discovered Neptune,
not by sweeping the heavens with
their telescopes, but by careful ciphering in
their studies. “Mr. Turner,” said a friend
to him one day, “I never see in nature the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_258"></a>[258]</span>
glows and colors you put into your pictures.”
“Ah! don’t you wish you could, though,”
was the painter’s reply. In an apple’s fall
Newton sees the law of gravitation.
Goethe sees in the sections of a deer’s
skull the spinal column modified. Emerson
sings:</p>

<h3>I.</h3>

<p>Yet the mind must first see through the
eye of sense, before it is capable of seeing
through the eye of reason. The universe,
that really belongs to the mind, the eye of
sense never sees, but it sees something that
suggests it. Through the eye of sense man
takes in a few colors, but these suggest
to Rubens the magnificent visions which
illuminate the art galleries of Europe.
Through the sense man hears a few notes,
but these are taken and multiplied into
the symphonies of Beethoven.</p>

<p>Through the eye of sense, Columbus
sees a few pieces of driftwood brought to
the shore by the waves of the ever-restless
sea; but these help him, through the eye of
reason, to see a new world with its virgin
forests, its wide-reaching plains and its
majestic mountain ranges. Agassiz sees
through the eye of sense an indentation on<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_260"></a>[260]</span>
a rock in the State of Maine. This gives
him a suggestion which helps him to see,
through the eye of reason, the icebergs and
the glaciers, which, in the early ages,
ground their way to the south. The man
of science sees through the eye of sense,
only a bit of chalk; but from this a suggestion
comes to him, which enables him to
see through the eye of reason the oozy bed
upon which the submarine cable rests; and
the life that sported in the vast oceans
when the Dover Cliffs were being formed.
Through the eye of sense Cuvier sees an
immense tooth, larger than any known at
the present. Through the eye of reason
he sees the huge animal in whose jaw it
was set. Upon the comprehensive, active
power of reason, man relies to determine
for him the elements good for food, the
power which serves his social nature, the
truth which furnishes his intellect, the
right which matches his will, and the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_261"></a>[261]</span>
beauty which corresponds with his
æsthetic nature.</p>

<p>The universe lends itself in its totality
to the scale and the dip of the particular
capacity or power through which man, for
the time being, seeks to appropriate it. It
stands before the sense of hunger in terms
of bread. It stands before the social nature
in terms of power. It stands before
the intellect in terms of truth. It stands
before the will in terms of law. It stands
before the æsthetic nature in terms of
beauty. The person who has related himself
to the world through all the powers of
his nature, finds it capable, by turns, of
feeding every faculty with which he is endowed.
The universe is now all bread,
now all power, now all truth, now all law,
and now all beauty. It will be any or all
of these, according to the side, or sides, of
himself through which he addresses it.
One of the great discoveries of modern<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_262"></a>[262]</span>
times is the correlation of forces. The persistent
force may express itself in heat, or
light, or electricity, or magnetism. These
are only different forms of the same thing,
and any one may pass to any of the others.
In the world, as a whole, we find the sense
of correlation inheres, as it relates itself to
the different faculties man has for taking
hold of it. As the correlate of hunger, it
is all bread; as the correlate of the social
nature, it is all power; as the correlate of
the intellect, it is all truth; as the correlate
of the will, it is all law, and as the correlate
of the æsthetic sense, it is all beauty. Objective
reality is addressed to the many
sides of human life, in order that the
whole of it may be used up for the purpose
of making a man. It is all to be drawn
into manhood. As all rivers meet in the
ocean, and all colors meet in the white ray
of light; so objective reality, in all that it is
for food, for power, for truth, for right, for<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_263"></a>[263]</span>
beauty; is to meet in human life, for nutriment,
for furnishment, and for the completion
of manhood. If you want to know
what the objective self of the fish is, look
at the ocean. If you want to know what
the objective self of the eagle is, look at
the sky. If you want to know what the
objective self of the elephant is, look at the
Asiatic jungle. If you want to know what
the objective self of man is, look at the
conditions of food, power, truth, law, and
beauty which environ him. The fish gets
the water, the bird gets the air, and the elephant
gets the jungle; but man, with a
nature illimitable, with capacities inexhaustible,
with hunger deep as truth, with
aspirations as wide as right, and with an
ideal as unfathomable as beauty, is the
child of the eternal God, and is to get the
fullness of his nature in nothing less than
the entire expression which God has made
of himself in objective reality.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_264"></a>[264]</span></p>

<h3>II.</h3>

<p>All truth, as we have before stated,
which man has tried to express, is but a
transcript of divine truth. The truth of
astronomy is a transcript from the reality of
the stars. The truth of botany is a transcript
from the reality of plants. The
truth of geology is a transcript from the
reality of the earth’s structure. All right,
which man has sought to embody in statutes,
in constitutions, in enactments, is but
a transcript from the will of God. So all
beauty, which man has attempted to symbolize,
is contained in the nature of things,
and has its source in God. The beauty
man has seen has taken in the process of
history many forms. It is seen in architecture,
sculpture, poetry, painting, and
music. These are different forms of the
same thing. As the persistent physical
force expresses itself in heat, light, electricity,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_265"></a>[265]</span>
and magnetism, so genius is the persistent
mental force which expresses itself in
art. Sometimes the persistent mental force
comes to such unity and fullness in some
massive soul that from him it goes out into
all the fine arts. Michael Angelo was by
turns poet, painter, sculptor, and architect.
Had he lived in Germany in the time of
Beethoven he would have added to his
other accomplishments that of music. The
noblest specimens of music are only great
cathedrals constructed out of sound, as
Michael Angelo’s “Moses” was a great epic
poem wrought in stone.</p>

<p>We wish to consider beauty in its relation
to the æsthetic sense, in two aspects
of itself.</p>

<p>The most important forms of beauty
have as the physical conditions of their existence
light and sound, and as the ideal
conditions of their existence space and time.
The names man gives to these forms of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_266"></a>[266]</span>
beauty, when he expresses them, or re-expresses
them, are painting and music. For
no element of man’s nature has more marvelous
provision been made than for the æsthetic
element. The objective conditions
of the beauty, which correspond to the subjective
æsthetic sense, are contained in
sound and light. Sound and light are the
invisible physical forces which play upon
the objects of nature, and call from them
the responses of melody and vision which
the æsthetic nature appropriates for ecstasy
and delight.</p>

<p>Capacity for sound is lodged in well-nigh
all created objects. Minerals, woods, gases,
and liquids even, contain the notes of the
musical scale. Builders of pianos, harps,
put no notes in the elements they use in
the construction of these instruments.
They simply comply with conditions necessary
to bring them out. The music we
get out of wood and steel and brass, as we<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_267"></a>[267]</span>
find them arranged in the piano, the organ,
the harp, by striking them at regular intervals,
is the melody breathed into them when
they were created. Beethoven, Handel,
and Mozart created no music. Their genius
was manifested simply in the power to
bring out of forest and mine and cane-brake
what God put into them.</p>

<p>As to what note a body shall give up
under tension and pressure, is owing to its
ultimate structure, and the elements which
compose it; and also the note latent in the
object by which it is struck, or pressed.
Sing into a piano and the same notes respond
which are used in the execution of
the song. A storm, howling through a
forest, makes a loud noise, but no music.
Its notes do not synchronize with those contained
in the limbs and leaves of the trees.
But when the low, sad murmur of the evening
winds gently strike the needles of the
long-leaf pine there is music. The notes of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_268"></a>[268]</span>
the one are related to the notes of the
other.</p>

<p>As all things have capacity for sound, so
well-nigh all created things have capacity
for color. The color which an object takes
on in the presence of light is determined
also by its ultimate structure and the elements
which constitute it. Nearly every
object absorbs a portion of the light and
throws back to the eye of the beholder a
portion. Bodies absorb those rays which
are synchronous with their constituent elements.
When the particles which compose
a body are not capable of vibrating at the
rate of any portion of the light particles,
then they are all thrown back, and the body
is pronounced white. It is to be observed
that no body has color or sound of its own,
but only the capacity for these. The note
of a body is discovered by striking it, and
its color by stimulating it with a light ray.</p>

<p>Another interesting fact is to be noted<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_269"></a>[269]</span>
here—that is the analogy between sound
and light, or music and painting. The
difference between a sound wave and a
light wave is only a difference of length.
The principles underlying them are the
same, and the methods by which they are
produced are the same. Sound waves, to
be heard, must vibrate at least as often as
sixteen beats to the second. Light waves,
in order to pass through the organ of vision,
and reach the retina of the eye, must not
vibrate at a less rate than four hundred
trillions of times to the second. The difference
between the eye and the ear is, one is
more refined than the other. A painting
is a silent piece of music, and a piece of
music is an audible picture. The notes of
the musical scale and the colors of the prismatic
scale are analogous. The distance
between C and A of the musical scale is
the same as the distance between red and
orange of the prismatic scale. The notes of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_270"></a>[270]</span>
the one scale may be translated into the
colors of the other. Harmony of colors in
a silk dress, would, if translated into their
analogous notes, produce a piece of music
that would be equally as pleasing to the
ear as the colors are to the eye. Painting
is only a more refined form of music. This
is not fancy; it is mathematics and science.
All things about us are capable of music,
silent or audible. Notes belonging to some
part of a great song are lodged in all
created objects. Things are not measured
off in continents, oceans, islands, mountains,
forests, and mines only, but also in octaves.
The music of the spheres is no longer a
dream of the poets, but in accordance with
exact science. The material system into
which we are born is capable, then, not
only of furnishing us food to eat and clothes
to wear, but music and painting for the
sense of the beautiful. A mere utilitarian,
bread-and-butter philosophy does not exhaust<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_271"></a>[271]</span>
the possibilities of even the material
world. In its very construction respect to
man’s higher nature was had, as well as to
his lower. By so much as music and harmony
of color surpass in their subtlety and
refinement the coarser elements necessary
to sustain the lower nature; by so much
has God emphasized the value of the higher
nature. Had God intended his children
for no higher plane than that upon which
the animals live, and no greater future for
them than that which belongs to “the
beasts that perish,” doubtless the beauty
would have been left out. Men have been
told, by one having authority, not to cast
their pearls before swine. The beauty that
was flung at the feet of man contained a
message to a side of himself keyed to a
radiant and imperishable realm.</p>

<p>Who does not feel, under the charm of
music, or the influence of a great painting,
reasons for high living which no words can<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_272"></a>[272]</span>
express? The tear which often gathers in
the eye of the most abandoned, hardened
man, under the power of song, bespeaks the
fact that chords have been touched which
vibrate responsive to no earthly interest or
relation.</p>

<h3>III.</h3>

<p>The melody in sound and the harmony
in color are correlated to the æsthetic
nature of man through the ear and the
eye. In the ear is found the musical
scale, and in the eye the prismatic scale.</p>

<p>Notes are in the ear which correspond
with the C D E F G A B of the musical
scale, and parts are in the eye which
correspond to the red, orange, yellow,
green, blue, indigo, and violet of the prismatic
scale. It is only through D in the
ear that D out of the ear can be heard,
and it is with C in the ear that C out of
the ear is heard.</p>

<p>If there were no notes in the ear except<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_273"></a>[273]</span>
D, and all other notes in nature were
destroyed, the ear could hear no notes at
all. A hears A, and B hears B, and C
hears C. What A hears, B does not hear,
and what C hears, A does not hear. What
is true of the ear is true of the eye. The
parts of the eye with which red is seen are
not the parts with which green is seen.
Red in the eye sees red out of the eye.
Blue in the eye sees blue out of the eye,
and green in the eye sees green out of the
eye. If there was in the prismatic scale
located in the eye only the part with
which blue is seen, no color in the world
would be visible except the blue. The
notes latent in all natural objects are
addressed to the æsthetic sense, through
the corresponding notes latent in the ear;
and the seven colors, capacity for which is
latent in all earthly objects, address themselves
to the æsthetic nature through the
corresponding capacities for color contained<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_274"></a>[274]</span>
in the eye. That man is related to
the kingdom of beauty in a sense which
marks him off from the animals below
him, is proven by the fact that he can take
the elements of this kingdom into his
imagination and send them back to the
realms of sense, in oratorios and paintings.
The masters have given all history ideal
and permanent setting by means of sound
and light. Man cannot only see the truth,
but repeat it; not only recognize the
right, but conform to it, and not only
appreciate beauty, but express it. In this
he has the evidence of his kinship with
the author of the true, the good, and the
beautiful. The lower animals, as far as
we know, may be thrilled with that
which is beautiful; we do know they never
repeat the beautiful. In the art galleries
and conservatories of the world all the
past is brought to life again and stands
before the eye and the ear, under the ideal<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_275"></a>[275]</span>
forms of time and space. Moses is not
only immortal in the laws which he wrote,
and in the race which he civilized, but,
through Michael Angelo’s genius, he has
been made eternal in the kingdom of
beauty.</p>

<p>Thus, through his æsthetic side, man
not only receives, but he gives. The
melody of sound and the harmony of color
not only come to him, but go from him;
and from him, too, charged and shot
through with all the suffering, temptation,
sin, and sacrifice he has known.</p>

<h3>IV.</h3>

<p>The empirical philosophy, which reduces
knowledge to sensations and morality
to laws imposed by prudence, and man
himself to the same plane of life occupied
by the lower animals, invades the domain
of æsthetics, and makes of beauty a mere
matter of individual feeling, local convention,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_276"></a>[276]</span>
and arbitrary fashion. This philosophy
of the dirt denies to mind any
inherent, creative activity, in the region
of knowledge, morals, or art. Now, it
is doubtless true, that food and power
and beauty of color and tone are addressed
to the lower animals; sufficiently,
at least, for them to get the means
of subsistence, and some low sort of
pleasure from them. They do this, however,
not by reason, but by instinct. The
bee is determined by its nature to build
his cell in accordance with mathematical
principles, and to store it with honey from
the leaves and the flowers. The bee does
this as naturally as water runs down-hill.
There is no calculation in it, and the bee
does not recognize itself in the process of
this work.</p>

<p>The bird may be determined in the selection
of its mate by brilliant plumage, or
joyous song, but this it does just as a rock<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_277"></a>[277]</span>
turned loose from the top of a house falls
to the ground. The evidence of a combining,
mental activity in man, to which things
in the outside world are addressed, in a
peculiar and distinct sense, is found in the
fact that man not only receives the things
that come to him, but sends them from
him in the forms of his own thought.</p>

<p>The bee appropriates the honeydew
that covers the surface of the leaves, stores
it in his cell, and eats it in the winter; but
who ever knew bees to plant out trees in
order that there might be leaves from
which to secure honeydew? Man finds
the bananas that grow in the tropics, and
the berries that grow in the temperate
zones, and eats them; but he sees how
bananas and berries grow, and so clears
fields and hedges, to insure a more abundant
crop.</p>

<p>The monkey hears the thunder and sees
the lightning as well as the man, but man<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_278"></a>[278]</span>
investigates the nature of lightning; he
sees the principle underlying its weird
movements, the things for which it has
affinity. So he contrives various methods
for utilizing it. The mind within him being
the same in kind as the mind which
sends the lightning, he sees how lightning
is sent, and sends it. He not only sees
thunder-storms, but how they are made.
So the professor creates them in glass jars
for the benefit of his class.</p>

<p>Nature presents herself to man under
uniform methods of action. Everywhere
is regularity and orderliness. He reproduces
this order in political and social life.
The laws without him kindle into expression
the moral magazine of volition within
him.</p>

<p>Nature presents herself to man as unity.
This implies mind. Unity is impossible
without mind. The mind underneath the
unity, without him, speaks to the mind<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_279"></a>[279]</span>
within him. Then by his own mind he
recreates the universe in literature.</p>

<p>He hears the cawing of rooks, the cooing
of doves, the purling of brooks, and the
roar of tempests. These, with all other
sounds in nature, are caught and combined
in the marvelous creation of Mozart and
Beethoven.</p>

<p>Much is said by the learned men who
are ever seeking to minify man’s place in
nature, about the reason and memory, and
intelligence, and even conscience of the
lower animals. It is almost enough to
make one wish he were a dog or a horse
when he reads how much sense and how
much conscience dogs and horses have.
Not much weight, however, will ever be
given to these long treatises on the intelligence
of the lower animals, until some bee
shall give us a book on mathematics, or
until some horse shall tell through one of
our agricultural journals the best time to<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_280"></a>[280]</span>
sow clover; or some dog shall give us
the philosophy of the chase. We see the
capacity of the human mind in Shakspere’s
plays. So one picture painted by
a cat, one poem written by a mule, one
philosophical dissertation composed by an
owl, or one cocoanut plantation planted by
the monkeys, would establish beyond question
that the high claims made for the
mental capabilities of these humble members
of the animal creation are justified.</p>

<p>Man grows wheat by the use of the
mind within him, which sees how the
mind without him has made the growth of
wheat possible. Man utilizes power, by
the use of the mind within him, which
recognizes how power is produced and controlled
by the mind without him. Man
sees truth, because the mind within him is
like the mind without him, which expresses
itself in truth. Man sees law, because
the mind within him is like the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_281"></a>[281]</span>
mind without him which ordained law.
So man sees beauty, because the mind
within him is like the mind without him,
which expresses itself in beauty. Food,
and truth, and law, and beauty, cannot be
reproduced by man, except by the laws of
mind acting in him as the laws of mind
do without him.</p>

<h3>V.</h3>

<p>What is the use of beauty? Like truth
and law, it looks beyond itself. It is to
help realize the purpose for which the
earth was created, the purpose which finds
its consummation in a perfect man.</p>

<p>Beauty comes to man, bearing intimations
of his high origin and also of his
glorious destiny. Under the magic spell
which beauty throws around him, he forgets
for the time being his limitations, his
fears, his doubts. He is lifted into a
realm of universal freedom, where all difficulties<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_282"></a>[282]</span>
disappear, where all conflicts are
eliminated. The æsthetic nature is not at
all seclusive and aristocratic. It receives
the melody, and symmetry, and harmony
which reason finds in the tones, and forms,
and colors of the outside world, and turns
over to it. These rich gifts are then
shared with all other human powers and
faculties. Hunger is served with food
set in painted china. Around the table,
where man satisfies his appetite, pictures
are hung, and the beef market and the
mill are built and arranged in accordance
with the dictates of symmetry and taste.
The college, where truth is taught, and the
courthouse, where law is administered,
are invested with all the beauty of the
architect’s genius. Thus beauty, high,
heaven-born, and refreshing, is drawn into
all the relations, and thrown around all the
institutions of life. It reduces friction,
redresses littleness, and adds to life good<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_283"></a>[283]</span>
cheer and depth. It smoothes the rough
places, rounds the sharp corners, and hangs
the bow of hope on the dark cloud of coming
trial.</p>

<p>The æsthetic sense, nurtured on beauty,
keeps before the minds of men and nations
a proper ideal of life. When the ideal
held before the mind at one period of advancement
is reached, the æsthetic sense
has already lifted another and a nobler, as
far ahead of the actual as the first. In presenting
to the living spirit ideals always in
advance of actual attainment, the æsthetic
nature opens the unending path of progress.
It is incorrect to suppose that the
ideal is worked out only in painting, symphony,
or cathedral. Its presence is manifest
in the useful, as well as the fine arts.
The ideal often gets itself translated into
the heel of a shoe, into the crown of a hat,
into the wheel of a wagon, into the fence
around the field, and into the structure of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_284"></a>[284]</span>
the mower and the reaper. It curves in
the arches of bridges, echoes in the sound
of the hammer, and breaks over the hills in
the whistle of the engine.</p>

<p>The progress of beauty in modern times
has not been in the direction of form or
coloring or symmetry, simply, but toward
wider distribution. In early times, its
ministry was to kings and scholars; it has
advanced by expanding. The pyramid of
Gizeh, the most expensive monument ever
seen, was reared to perpetuate the memory
of a great Egyptian king. A country was
drained of revenue and of life to regale the
pride of one man. The Parthenon ministered
to a few great men in Greece. The
cathedrals of the middle ages blest and
helped a wider circle. But it was left to
the time which is ours to build churches
and chapels, as broad in their aims and
ministry as the life of humanity. The
early poetry concerned itself about the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_285"></a>[285]</span>
wars of gods and the contentions of kings.
But as the sacredness of human life came
to be seen more and more, did it tend to
catch within the sweep of its rhythm the
incidents and traditions and loves of the
common people. The ideal in our day is
being worked out in fields of waving grain,
into the cattle upon the hills, into the
homes of the people. It is being turned
into orchards and vineyards. It is being
traced in vines and flowers over the poor
man’s cottage. The ideals were once
housed and confined in the museums;
now they are being turned out into the
street. It was once the custom to bring
Venus and Diana, by the aid of the chisel,
from rough marble. The tendency now is
to put the beauty of Venus and the enterprise
of Diana into the spirits of our
women. Sublime conceptions were once
mainly realized in temples and cathedrals,
but now we would see them distributed<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_286"></a>[286]</span>
into dwellings for families, into schools
for children, and into churches for the
true worship of God. We would see them
in bridges spanning all the rivers, in mills
grinding the people’s bread, in factories
spinning their clothes, and in railroads
transporting their products. We would
see them lifted into an asylum for the
blind, a shelter for the orphan, and a home
for the aged and infirm. We would hear
them in the whirl of the spindle, in the ring
of the hammer, in the splash of the paddle,
and in the sound of the flying train. We
would hear them in the steady march of
progress, and in the pulse-beats of the
happy plowman. Beauty is to be used
to stimulate human courage, to embellish
human spirit, and to enlarge human thought.
Life’s shadows are to be chased by the light
of eternity’s day, and its tumult hushed by
the repose of eternity’s harmony. The
æsthetic element in man’s nature was<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_287"></a>[287]</span>
appointed to receive the beauty provided
for it. But it was to be God’s almoner;
having received it, also freely to give it.
Thus it was to be the power whose function
should be to put the whole of life into
terms of harmony. Bernard Palissy put
his ideal into a white enamel for his pottery;
Columbus worked his ideal into a new
world; Morse left his in the electric telegraph;
Cyrus W. Field turned his into the
submarine cable; and Thomas A. Edison
has given his to the world in the telephone.
It is not to be inferred, however, that those
who work their ideals out in the useful
arts contribute more to the making of men
than those who express their ideals in
poetry, painting, sculpture, or music. The
tendency of beauty to get down into the
ordinary work and relations of life is an
intimation that all life should be beautiful
in itself, and in all expressions which it
makes of itself. The æsthetic sense is the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_288"></a>[288]</span>
badge of man’s royalty. A tutor was once
employed to teach the son of a king. The
young prince was sometimes disobedient.
But in the esteem of the tutor, it was not
quite proper to whip the son of a king with
a common switch. So to the lapel of the
boy’s coat the teacher pinned a piece of
purple ribbon. When the young prince
manifested a disposition to defy authority,
the instructor pointed with the end of the
rod to the purple ribbon on his coat. This
was an appeal to his royal blood.</p>

<p>Not a flower gathers on the limbs of a
rose bush but addresses the high and purple
nature of everyone who beholds it. In
Mexico, where the average of life is so low,
the flowers which grow in such profusion
are about all that is left to keep the people
reminded that they are the children of God,
the author of all beauty. The highest
evidence of the remaining worth of the
Mexican people is found in the fact that<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_289"></a>[289]</span>
they love flowers with a deep and unfailing
passion.</p>

<h3>VI.</h3>

<p>Beauty is to feed enthusiasm. Tones
and colors are to be used to jostle the elements
of mind, and will, and emotion into
harmony with the high and holy life of our
Father who art in Heaven. Beauty is to
nerve the soldier for the battle, the martyr
for the stake, and the hero for his work.
There is a height of development to which
the human spirit aspires, that the logical
understanding is unable to reach. Here,
then, where truth in logical form fails,
beauty comes, and helps the human spirit
to disentangle itself from the sphere of
contradictions and antagonisms.</p>

<p>Truth and right command the spirit by
an external necessity; beauty moves it by
an internal necessity and starts it to vibrating
in the very centers of its being, in consonance
with itself. Beauty lifts it to a<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_290"></a>[290]</span>
pinnacle where the horizon quadrates with
its irrepressible longings; and where the
whole of life is rounded into an orb from
which all strife is eliminated, and all discord
extracted. Men seek artificial stimulants
and narcotics, because of the abiding
conviction they have, that their lives were
keyed to some ideal realm of unity and
freedom.</p>

<p>What intoxicants do to the detriment of
the spirit, beauty accomplishes to its health
and vigor. It is carried by beauty into no
land of vague dream, and unreal delirium,
but into a radiant region where the environing
conditions exactly match its undying
hopes.</p>

<span class="smaller">THE PROVISION FOR THE SPIRITUAL NATURE OF MAN.</span></h2>

</div>

<p>In speaking of the spiritual nature of
man, reference is not had to a side or faculty
or power of himself, but to his real,
essential life. Man is a spirit. All faculties
and powers exist for him as such. The
hunger, and the food provided for it, are to
serve man as spirit. The social element,
and the power provided for it, are to serve
him as spirit. The intellect and truth, the
will and right, the æsthetic sense and
beauty, are all to serve him as spirit. The
correlate of man as spirit, on one side of
himself, we have seen to be the life of
humanity—the correlate of man as spirit,
on the other side of himself, is the life of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_294"></a>[294]</span>
God. Man’s spiritual nature is mediated
to him on one side by the family, by the
school, by the institutions of the state, by
the establishments of trade, by the newspaper,
by literature, by art, by history.
Man’s spiritual nature is mediated to him
on the other side by love, embodied in the
one Mediator between God and man.</p>

<p>The mud-philosophy of Locke, and
Hume, and Mill, and Spencer dissolves
spirit, because it dissolves the idea of a
mind, an ego, or an external world. If the
mind can know nothing but a succession of
things in time, if nothing but a constant
flow and flux of sensations; of course it cannot
know itself, only as a sensation in the
perpetual procession of sensations always
passing by. But how is it possible for the
mind to know a succession of things in
time, and a procession of things in space,
unless it is itself out of and apart from the
succession and the procession. One sensation,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_295"></a>[295]</span>
say of the self, in a flow of sensations,
could not know itself as a part of such a
flow, without knowing itself as related to a
before and an after in the process. To
know even a procession of sensations, we
must have a spirit that stands still and
does not pass on with the procession. The
spirit, then, must be out of time to know
succession, and out of space to know procession,
and self-conscious, so as to distinguish
itself from the succession and the
procession. The human spirit is something
in the midst of time, yet passes not with
the tides of time. It is to the succession
of things ever passing through it, and to
the procession of sensations ever passing
before it, like some mighty Teneriffe with
its peak of Teyde in the midst of the sea,
pushing its proud head up 12,000 feet
above the sea, and contrasting with its ever
changing waves, the immutability of eternity.
Man, as a spirit, is after God, the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_296"></a>[296]</span>
most universal of all facts. He is illimitable
in more ways than space, remaining
when all the events of time have passed,
and with a nature dipping into the eternal
spirit of God. The respect in which man
is made in the image of God, is, that he
is endowed with self-consciousness, and
self-determination. Self-consciousness and
self-determination are the universal forms
of spiritual activity. Man, as a self-conscious
and self-determining spirit, is not independent.
He must find his true self
beyond himself. He is dependent upon
the absolute self-consciousness and self-determination
of God. He is the child of
God, and as there cannot be an absolute
without a relative, he is the relativity of
the absolute. God’s nature is the ground
of man’s nature, and in God he is mirrored
to himself.</p>

<p>In God man lives and moves and has his
being. In finding God, man finds himself.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_297"></a>[297]</span>
In the revelation of God is the revelation
of man. God is a spirit and man is a
spirit; but man, as a relative spirit, comes
to himself in God, the absolute spirit; as
the life-germ of the acorn comes to itself in
the natural conditions of soil and sky which
environ it.</p>

<h3>I.</h3>

<p>As man is essentially spirit, he can never
come to unity, only as he comes to it in
himself as a spirit. As long as he abandons
himself to mere bread, or power, or
knowledge, or law, or beauty, there is
contradiction. Not in any one of these can
he find full-orbed life. These all bring
nutriment to him, as a spirit, from the several
spheres to which they are variously
correlated. But provision is made not only
for the sides and faculties of himself, but
for the essential nature of himself. We
have seen how hunger was met by bread,
the needs of the social nature by power, intellect<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_298"></a>[298]</span>
by truth, will by law, and the
æsthetic sense by beauty; but here we
come to life, and find that love, timeless
and illimitable love, alone corresponds to it.
But love can only find its embodiment and
its expression in life. Therefore, love has
taken the form of life to meet the needs of
man as a spirit.</p>

<p>We do not propose to discuss this subject
dogmatically. The writer believes in
dogmatism; but in this work the attempt
has been to treat man, and the things provided
for him, scientifically. We have taken
nothing for granted, and have intended
to say nothing but what was warranted
by the facts. That man is a spirit, and related
to an unseen realm, is attested by the
fact that all round this world temples and
mosques, and synagogues and churches lift
themselves sublimely, or modestly, to the
sky. That there is something in man that
seeks provision from beyond the range of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_299"></a>[299]</span>
sense and sight, no one in his senses can
deny. This deep and fundamental and irrepressible
need of man’s nature finds its
correlate in love. Speaking out of the
depths of his life, it is an everlasting call
for sympathy, for reconciliation, for pardon,
for peace. Love gives sympathy, insures
reconciliation, grants pardon, and secures
peace. But love can only come from the
unseen and eternal in the form of life.
Let us see how the love expressed in the
life and sacrifice and death of Jesus Christ,
as the embodiment of divine love, is set
over against the spiritual nature of man, as
its correlate; as completely as bread is set
over against hunger, or the truth against
the intellect, or as beauty is set over against
the æsthetic sense. We believe this is so
in the nature of things, and will finally be
taught as truth, as absolute and unfailing
as the multiplication table. Men will come
to it, after a while, not only as a dogmatic<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_300"></a>[300]</span>
doctrine taught by the churches, but also
as absolute doctrine, taught by the constitution
and needs of human nature. The
time will come when to doubt this will not
simply be to write one’s self down as mean,
but as mentally unbalanced. If Jesus
Christ, as love, is the correlate of the
spiritual needs of the human race, then his
life is peculiar and unique. It cannot be
classed with any other life. It cannot be
measured by any rule used to measure
other things or other lives. We propose
to test this life by a principle said, by
scientific men, to have universal application
in this time.</p>

<h3>II.</h3>

<p>The doctrine of the correlation, equivalence,
persistence, transmutability and indestructibility
of force, or the conservation
of energy has had vast influence upon the
thought and life of our time. It has furnished<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_301"></a>[301]</span>
a new opening through which to behold
the nature of things. It has given to
men a new working hypothesis and richer
views and conceptions of the universe and
its author.</p>

<p>The tremendous advancement made in
the material civilization of the present is
due more to this than any other scientific
doctrine or principle. According to Professor
Balfour Stewart, there are eight forms
of energy or force. The energy of visible
motion, visible energy of position, heat
motion, molecular separation, atomic or
chemical separation, electrical separation,
electricity in motion, and radiant energy.
Now taking this earth as a complete whole,
containing within itself all these forms of
energy, and so isolated from the rest of the
universe as to receive nothing from it
and to add nothing to it, then the principle
of the correlation of forces asserts that
the sum of all these forces is constant.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_302"></a>[302]</span></p>

<p>“This does not assert that each is constant
in itself, or any other of the forms of force
enumerated, for in truth they are always
changing about into each other—now some
visible energy being changed into heat or
electricity, and heat or electricity being
changed back again into visible energy;
but it only means that the sum of all the
energies taken together is constant. There
are eight variable quantities, and it is only
asserted that their sum is constant, not by
any means that they are constant themselves.”</p>

<p>For the purpose of elucidating our principle
in the realm of nature, we will consider
it as it applies to some of the useful
forces whose effects we can measure and
whose origin we can trace and determine.</p>

<p>There is the force of conserved fuel.
Away back in the carboniferous period of
the world’s history, there grew immense
forests, which in succeeding ages were<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_303"></a>[303]</span>
turned under the earth, and, in the process
of the years, were changed into coal and
oil and gas. These have been treasured
for untold ages in the mountains and in the
bowels of the earth. Now they are brought
forth by the applied intelligence of man,
to turn his wheel, draw his car, cook his
food, propel his plow, and to light his
home and his street. The force in one ton
of coal is capable of accomplishing more
work in a few hours than one man could
in a lifetime. All this force, as well as
that contained in the growing forests of to-day,
originated in the sun.</p>

<p>There is the conserved force of food.
This is found primarily in the grass, the
wheat, the rice, the fruit, which grow in
our fields and orchards. The lower animals
feed on these, and through the process
of digestion and assimilation, they are
transmuted into blood and bone and muscle—thus
furnishing man, who stands at<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_304"></a>[304]</span>
the top and the end of the creative process,
with a more refined higher form of
food. But whether in the shape of grass,
rice, wheat, or in the more refined form of
animal flesh, these various elements of food
are only so much transmuted sunshine.
Before they ever adorned the surface of
our fields, or moved in the lowing herd
over the meadow, they were held in solution
in the sunshine. The food, the fuel,
and the animal life of our earth are all
traceable to the sun.</p>

<p>There is the conserved force of flowing
water. This turns the wheel, spins the
thread, gins the cotton, weaves the cloth,
and grinds the corn. All the force that
water possesses for the performance of
work, comes from the sun. The warm
rays of the sun, coming down on southern
seas and rivers, causes the waters thereof
to evaporate, and then it is carried on the
wings of north-bound winds to a colder<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_305"></a>[305]</span>
clime. There the diffused waters gather
themselves into clouds and fall in rain to
flow down the rivers, thus exchanging
their energy of position, which they have
obtained from the sun, for the actual
energy of the turning wheel.</p>

<p>There is also the conserved force of
moving winds. By the aid of this ships
spread their sails, and pass from continent
to continent with the products of the
earth. Again all the force the winds
possess for the accomplishment of work
comes from the sun. The rays of the
sun come down with great intensity upon
certain parts of the earth and heat the atmosphere.
Into these heated places come
the winds from colder regions. Thus currents
and counter-currents are created.
By putting the wheel of the windmill into
these currents this force is converted into
the ground wheat and the drawn water.
Thus all the different forms of force displayed<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_306"></a>[306]</span>
in the growing forests, the waving
harvest fields, the flying birds, the lowing
herds, the rushing railway train, the whir
of the spindle, the ring of the hammer, and
the pulsating blood come directly from the
sun. The force, too, seen in all these physical,
vegetable, animal, commercial realms,
is the exact equivalent of what was
poured into them from the sun. The
earth contains no other force capital than
what was paid over to it by the sun. It
has issued no currency of its own, not even
enough to run a watch, or to send the blood
once around the body, or even to transport
a piece of bread to a starving man. All
the force our earth possesses is borrowed,
and if we were to cease to borrow, we
would be bankrupt in a single day. We
are to remember, too, that by so much
force as the sun has parted with to our
earth, and to other worlds which look to it
for supplies, by so much has its own force<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_307"></a>[307]</span>
been decreased. If we knew how much
force the sun had in the beginning, and
would subtract from this amount all that it
has given away to the present time, we
might be able to form some estimate of its
assets to-day.</p>

<p>We know not what the sun’s resources
are. We know not by what methods it
has been replenishing its supplies of light
and heat for ages past; whether by chemical
combination, meteoric impact, or condensation;
we only know by so much as it
has in the ages past parted with, by so
much less force it has to-day. That it has
been able to supply our world and others
like it, however, with heat and light and
physical life for ages, is not at all strange
when we remember what an immense ball
of fire the sun is. It has a diameter of a
million miles, in round numbers. Storms,
which travel across our world at the rate
of sixty miles an hour, would move across<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_308"></a>[308]</span>
the surface of the sun at the rate of twenty
thousand miles an hour. The flames of a
burning forest, which on our world would
rise one hundred feet in the air, on the
sun would rise to the height of two hundred
thousand miles. The sun, too, has enough
force on hand to supply our earth and others
with heat for untold ages yet to come, but
unless its supply is replenished, the time
will come when it will be bankrupt and
nothing but a burnt out char in the heavens.
This is so, because the sun is the center of
that great natural realm, the universal law
of which is the law of exclusiveness.</p>

<p>In accordance with this law what the
sun has in the way of force the other
planets do not have, and what other planets
obtain from the sun that body has forever
lost. This is only another name for the
law of the correlation of forces. This law
applies not only to the force of the sun,
but to all forces on this earth which come<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_309"></a>[309]</span>
from that body. What one tree gathers
into itself is at the expense of the general
fund of force which goes to make trees.
What one bird takes into his body is at
the expense of all force which goes to make
birds. What one man takes into his
physical frame is at the expense of the
general fund of force which goes to make
human bodies. Whatever amount of force
is contained in the cloud, in conserved
water to turn the wheel, or in conserved
electricity to carry the message, is at the
expense of the general fund of force.</p>

<p>According to the doctrine of the correlation
of forces, the rising up of force in one
place involves the subsidence of force in
another place. The amount rising up, too,
is the exact equivalent of the amount subsiding.
When a rock falls from a church
steeple the earth rises as much to meet the
rock, in proportion to its mass, as the rock
falls to meet the earth, in proportion to its<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_310"></a>[310]</span>
mass. When a man shoots a rifle ball
from a gun, as much force goes back
against his shoulder as goes out through
the muzzle of the gun. What the gun
lacks in velocity it makes up in mass, and
what the ball lacks in mass it makes up in
velocity. When a pine tree is cut down
and split into small pieces and put into an
engine, just the same amount of heat is
gathered from it that was garnered from
the sun in the fifty years of its growth.
This heat is also converted into an equivalent
of steam, and this steam into an equivalent
amount of mechanical motion. The
sunshine, the pine tree, the heat, the steam,
the mechanical motion, are only different
forms of the same thing. Scientists of the
materialistic school claim that this law
holds good not only in the realm of the
natural world, but in the mental and moral,
as well. Prof. Thomas H. Huxley said, in
a celebrated address in this country once,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_311"></a>[311]</span>
that a speech was only so much transmuted
mutton. According to Prof. Alexander
Bain, there are five chief powers, or forces
in nature: one mechanical or molar, the
momentum of moving matter; the others,
molecular, are embodied in the molecules,
also supposed in motion—these are light,
heat, chemical force, electricity. One member
of vital energies, the nerve force, allied
to electricity, fully deserves to rank in the
correlation. According to this same distinguished
authority, mind is only a refined
and sublimated form of physical
force. In this view the great poems,
paintings, and literature of the world
would be only so much transmuted sunshine—a
higher form of the same force we
see manifested in the flying railway train.
In the one case the solidified sunshine contained
in the coal is transmuted through
the furnace of the engine into mechanical
motion; in the other, the heat contained in<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_312"></a>[312]</span>
food is transmuted through the human
brain into literature and art. Perhaps it
might not be at wide variance from the
truth to assume that the force, mental or
otherwise, expended by men who spend
their lives under the dominion of the
natural law of exclusiveness, may be accounted
for in accordance with the doctrine
of the correlation of forces. Even
mind, when earthly and low, is subject to
the bearing of the law of sin and death,
which is the scriptural name for the law of
exclusiveness.</p>

<h3>III.</h3>

<p>It might be plausibly contended that
the religious movement of the prophet Mohammed
could be accounted for in accordance
with the doctrine of the correlation of
forces. It is to be remembered that the
personality of Mohammed is no more the
equivalent of the vast movement which has<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_313"></a>[313]</span>
existed and exists to-day under his name,
than the acorn is the quantitative equivalent
of the immense oak tree which has
grown from it. The acorn, plus all the
oxygen, carbon, hydrogen, nitrogen, and
other forces of sky and earth which it
caught and organized, is the equivalent of
the oak tree. The soil and the sky contain
oaks in solution. Through acorns
these are precipitated into trees.</p>

<p>The mental, political, and social atmosphere
of Turkey contained the Mohammedan
movement in solution before Mohammed
was born. Through him it was precipitated
into Koran, mosque, prayer, and
worship.</p>

<p>Mohammed relied for success upon the
methods with which men ordinarily succeed.
He appealed to men’s love of fame,
of pleasure, of conquest, of power, of
riches. He simply organized the latent
aspirations, and hopes, and fears of his<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_314"></a>[314]</span>
countrymen into a great kingdom, essentially
secular and sensual.</p>

<p>In accordance with the principle of the
correlation of forces, it might be possible
to account for the success of Buddha, Confucius,
Cæsar, and Bonaparte. What we
wish now, is to apply this doctrine, which
the materialists claim is capable of measuring
everything, from an atom to Milton’s
“Paradise Lost,” to the life and work of
Christ. Granting, as we must, that all
physical force may be estimated by it, and
even that the work and thought of men, in
so far as they live under the natural law of
selfishness or exclusiveness, may be estimated
by it.</p>

<p>What we desire to inquire is, if the life
and work of Christ form no exception to
its operation, as ordinarily regarded. Can
we, in accordance with this principle, account
for the life and influence of Christ
on the assumption that he was only a man?<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_315"></a>[315]</span>
Has no more force issued from the person
of Christ than subsided when only a man
named Jesus was crucified?</p>

<p>We have seen how the forms of physical
force in the shape of fuel, food, moving
waters, and winds may be traced directly
to the sun. Let us also consider some of
the forms of spiritual force which are
traceable directly to the life of Christ, and
inquire if they may be accounted for as
the force which comes from the sun may
be, by the principle of the convertibility
of force.</p>

<h3>IV.</h3>

<p>There is the conserved spiritual force of
Christian literature. This is stored up
in the Bibles of the world, in commentaries
upon its text, in expositions of its
principles, in books illustrating its meaning.
If all the Bibles of the world, books
written about the Bible—in favor of it or
against it—and all the books which have<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_316"></a>[316]</span>
been inspired by some truth or precept
taught in the Bible, and all the books
which owe their existence directly or indirectly
to the Bible, were burned up,
Christendom would be well-nigh without
literature. All Bibles and all books and
literature which have grown out of the
Bible owe their existence directly to Christ.
They have come as straight from him as
the coal in the mountain has come from the
sun. Much force has been expended in the
writing of all these books and in printing
them, binding them, circulating them.
They represent millions of dollars, ages of
painful, patient thought. Into them a marvelous
amount of force has lifted itself—physical
force, money force, thought force.
We are to find its equivalent. All the force
that has arisen in Christian literature has
subsided at some point, and the amount that
subsided is the exact equivalent of that
which has arisen. It must be remembered,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_317"></a>[317]</span>
too, that distinctly Christian literature has
not made its way in the world, as have
the writings of Homer and Plato, by their
affinity with man’s fancy. The wonderful
interest which has ever centered around
the Bible is totally different in kind and
degree from that which centers around the
works of Shakspere. Whatever there is
of literary merit, of philosophic thought,
or of poetic depth in the Bible is incidental.</p>

<p>There is the conserved spiritual force of
Christian art. The masterpieces in painting,
sculpture, music, poetry, and architecture
are Christian. The inspiration which
produced Milton’s “Paradise Lost,” Handel’s
“Messiah,” Powers’ “Eve,” and St. Peter’s
at Rome, has all come from Christ. In
the conception and production of these an
immense amount of the most subtle, refined
force has been expended.</p>

<p>There is the conserved force of Christian<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_318"></a>[318]</span>
money. This has taken the form of
church buildings, buildings for education,
for orphans, for the sick, for the wretched
and the poor. There is not a great city
in the world to-day without a Christian
church edifice. They are the expressions
of a great force, of which we are seeking
to find the equivalent. They owe their existence
directly to the person of Christ.
The millions of money which have been
spent in their erection have been because
of love to him. They are as directly related
to him as the oak tree is to the sun.
If all these churches were burned down to-day,
men would begin at once the erection
of better ones to take their places. The
conserved force of Christian money, then,
which tends to lift itself into church edifices,
is not exhausted in those which
already stand upon the earth; but just
as much as has lifted itself into brick
and marble, and window, and dome, and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_319"></a>[319]</span>
pinnacle is ready to take the same forms
if the necessity for them were laid upon
the Christian world.</p>

<p>There is the conserved force of Christian
home life. The force here referred to
is not manifest in the life itself, but in the
form which family life has taken in the
Christian world. There is hardly a home
in Christendom to-day, but has been
formed directly or indirectly with reference
to Christ. Into those places where
character is formed, where revolutions are
started, where Wesleys and Gladstones are
developed, where eternal issues pend,
Christ has come quietly and silently to
regulate, to dominate and control. To
thus influence, regulate, and vitally touch
homes, to thus determine their form,
appointment, and character, requires a
great deal of force.</p>

<p>There is the conserved force implied in
the inception and perpetuation of the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_320"></a>[320]</span>
Christian Calendar. Infidels, materialists,
and atheists, in dating their letters, pay
tribute to the character of Christ in the
fact that they recognize he has ushered in
a new era. Christ has claimed and held
through nearly two thousand years one
day out of every week to be devoted to
his service. The day upon which he was
born is celebrated in the hearts of men
and in the arts of men. To change the
world’s calendar, to inaugurate and make
permanent a new date, to impel the world
to set apart a day for his worship, to
furnish the world with new festivals and
holidays, has required, certainly, a vast
amount of force. This we are to trace
and determine, and we are also to find its
equivalent.</p>

<p>There is the conserved Christian force
implied in the fact that Christ has won the
hearts of men. To win the disinterested
love of one man takes much force, more<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_321"></a>[321]</span>
than most men have. To win the love of
a state takes more. But to win and to hold,
through the perturbations and revolutions
of kingdoms and republics, the undying
love of the best and purest men on earth
requires an infinite amount of force. This
point in Christ’s character greatly impressed
the first Napoleon. Said he, “I
know men. Christ is not a man. I have
seen the time when I could inspire thousands
to die for me, but it took the inspiration
of my presence and the power of my
word. Since I am away from men, a
prisoner on Helena, no one will die for me.
Christ, on the other hand, has been away
from the world nearly two thousand years,
and yet there are millions who would die
for him. I tell you, Christ is not a man.
I know men.”</p>

<h3>V.</h3>

<p>It would be impossible to recount all the
institutions, books, civilizations, laws, discoveries,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_322"></a>[322]</span>
inventions, homes and hearts, into
which the force of Christ’s life has for the
past nineteen hundred years been lifting itself.
As the sun expresses itself in the
meadow, and lifts itself into the trees of the
forests, so Christ has been embodying himself
in the institutions, homes, and thoughts
of men. The scientists say all force can be
accounted for. When force has risen up at
one point it has subsided at another: the
amount rising up being the exact equivalent
of that subsiding. Upon this principle
we are seeking to account for all this
force that, coming from Christ, has expressed
itself in the domestic, social, political,
and ecclesiastical institutions of men.
More has risen than can be computed by
human arithmetic, or compassed by human
imagination, or comprehended by human
thought. Where did it come from? Where
did it subside? At what point did it disappear
to rise again in such overwhelming<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_323"></a>[323]</span>
volume, and such sweeping and far-reaching
influence? We go back through eighteen
hundred years. We are standing in Jerusalem.
We hear conflicting reports of a
strange, daring young man. At length he
is pointed out to us. There is nothing remarkable
about his appearance. He is a
Jew. He was born among the poor. He
is not noted for culture. He has no social
position. He has no money. He has no
political power or prestige. He has no
army at his command. He has no philosophical
system. He is connected with no
academy. He is only thirty-three years
old. His words are contained in no books.
They are simply in the memory of his disciples.
He is misunderstood. His own
disciples do not know what to make of
him. Finally he is arrested, and tried, and
condemned, and crucified. He dies between
two thieves, scorned, scoffed, buffeted, and
friendless. Keep in mind the principle we<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_324"></a>[324]</span>
are considering. All force can be measured.
No more force rises up than subsides.
Action and reaction are equal. We are
seeking to account, in accordance with this
principle, for the vast amount of force
Christ has poured into the institutions and
thoughts of humanity. Is this young man’s
life, seemingly so insignificant and weak,
the exact equivalent of all the churches,
schools, colleges, arts, literature, homes,
governments, sacrifice, heroism, good works,
martyrdom, patience, love, and hope that
have by general consent resulted from his
existence in the world? If so, was he only
a man? Multiply thirty-three years by
poverty, toil, contempt, sorrow, and crucifixion,
and you have one product. Multiply
nineteen hundred years by millions of
churches, schools, and homes; by millions
of books, paintings, and poems; by social
position, wealth, and power; by success,
triumph, and conquest; by love, mercy, and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_325"></a>[325]</span>
truth; by a hold upon humanity unequaled,
and by an influence on home and thought
unrivaled, and you have another product.
The question is: does one of these products
seem to be the equivalent of the other?
Does not the outcome surpass by an infinite
degree the income? Is not the evolution
out of all proportion to the involution?
Has not a great deal more force risen up
than seemingly subsided? Is there not
much more power seemingly on this side
the Cross than there was on the other?
Manifestly and clearly Christ’s life and
work cannot be accounted for by the principle
of the correlation of forces.</p>

<p>Mohammed’s success and disciples we can
understand. He succeeded by the ordinary
methods by which men succeed. He
appealed to men’s love of fame, conquest,
wealth, power, pleasure. He offered men,
as a reward for their fealty to him, a great
earthly kingdom, and such a heaven beyond<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_326"></a>[326]</span>
the grave as would regale the senses, please
the fancy, and gratify the appetites. He
simply organized and applied the latent
earthly forces already existing in his countrymen.
His success is in line with that
of Cæsar and Bonaparte. The kingdom
which he proposed to establish was merely
an earthly, sensual kingdom. His methods
were carnal, the motives to which he appealed
were sensual, and the hopes which
he inspired were carnal. Christ, on the
other hand, condemned men’s love of conquest,
power, fame, riches, and pleasure.
He made the conditions of discipleship to
consist in the denial of self and in the relinquishment
of all earthly hopes, gratifications,
and prospects. “If you find your
life in my kingdom,” said he, “you must
lose it in this.” He proposed to build up
a kingdom as wide as the world, and as
lasting as eternity, without adopting a single
method or utilizing any of the means<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_327"></a>[327]</span>
ordinarily relied on for success. Not only
did he propose a new kingdom, but to populate
it with new men, motives, hopes,
conceptions, and opinions. Hence, to come
into his kingdom, men were to be made
over. They were to die to self, to the
world, to pleasure. So Christ’s work and
influence in the world not only forms an
exception to the principle of the correlation
of forces, but here we have an unparalleled
amount of force rising up when, to all human
appearances, none subsided at all.</p>

<h3>VI.</h3>

<p>A poor young carpenter dies. He goes
down in ignominy. Amid the jeers and
contempt of the multitude, he goes down
into the grave. But from that moment,
commotion begins. Forgiveness of sin in
the name of Christ is preached; disciples
are won; books are written; civilizations
are touched; movements are inaugurated;<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_328"></a>[328]</span>
persecutions, bloody and relentless, are
waged. The fires of hate are kindled;
storms from all round the social, political,
and religious sky gather, and howl, and
empty their fury upon the new movement.
Nothing impedes it; fire cannot hinder it;
persecution intensifies it; death does not
alarm it. Now, we submit, does not such a
movement, starting from such a source, and
moving out with such vigor, and becoming
intenser and deeper as it is extended, form
a remarkable and singular exception to the
principle we are considering? Is there any
rule among men by which it may be estimated
and classified and labeled? Can
any human, or logical, or philosophical
formula or principle measure the multiform
and widely diversified facts in this
case? Does it not form an exception to
all rules and human methods of measurements?
Do we not augment the difficulties
of accounting for the work of Christ<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_329"></a>[329]</span>
by minifying him, and calling him a mere
man? Is not the easier way to account for
Christ’s work, to accord to him all that he
claims for himself and all that his disciples
claimed for him. He said, “All
power is given to me in heaven and in
earth.” If we accept this as true, we can
account for his work. But in this view,
we will see that his life was divine and
one with the Father of us all. Then we
will see that he was the Son of God, the
Word made flesh, the incarnation of the
divine mind and wisdom and power. It
is impossible to account for the life and
work of Christ by the principles with
which physical force and merely human
force and thought are measured. The sun
is the center of the system of nature, a system
destined to end. Any system, the
center of which is gradually losing its
force, cannot last. Christ is the center of a
spiritual system totally different from the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_330"></a>[330]</span>
system of nature. By all the force the sun
parts with to the worlds about it, by so
much less has it. It is gradually losing itself,
to find itself no more forever. Christ
is pouring his force into the system of
which he is the center, but by such a process
he is not losing his force, but increasing
it. By losing himself he finds himself.
The universal law of the system of which
he is the center, is the law of communion.
The force he gives away comes back to
him augmented by the personality of all
who partake of it. Instead of becoming
poorer by giving, he becomes richer. This
great truth St. Paul saw when he said: “All
things are yours, whether Paul, or Apollos,
or Cephas, or the world, or life, or death,
or things present, or things to come, all are
yours, and ye are Christ’s; and Christ is
God’s.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_331"></a>[331]</span></p>

<h3>VII.</h3>

<p>One life has appeared among men, then,
that was all love. Jesus Christ is the only
original, absolutely unselfish life that has
been lived on earth. The saints have
found the secret, and strength, and inspiration
of their unselfishness and love in
him. The love which matches and meets
the illimitable nature of the human spirit
is embodied in a life that cannot be measured
by the ordinary rules and standards of
men. The object of which hunger is the
subject, is bread; the object of which intellect
is the subject, is truth; the object
of which will is the subject, is law; the
object of which the æsthetic sense is the
subject, is beauty; the object of which
the spiritual nature is the subject, is
Jesus Christ. The spirit of man which
has for its correlate in time, the race, has
for its correlate in eternity, the life of one<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_332"></a>[332]</span>
in which is summed up all power, all truth,
all law, all beauty, and all love. As the
embodiment of love the human spirit finds
in Christ the climate and the conditions
exactly adapted to its own realization.
The plan and pattern, the invisible framework
and ideal of every man’s life is
Christian. To be an oak is to be a perfect
acorn, to be an apple is to be a complete
flower, to be a Christian is to be a
complete man.</p>

<span class="smaller">THE PERMANENCE OF THE COMPLETED LIFE OF MAN.</span></h2>

</div>

<p>Back of the movement which began in
creation and culminated in man, we posited
the mind of a self-conscious, self-determining,
self-active, personal God. Necessity
was upon us to assume a first principle of
some kind, and it seemed proper to have
one large enough to account for the facts
we were about to consider. The first principle
Thales set up was water. In water
he saw the origin of all and the end of
all. But all that came out of water must,
in the end, find its death in water. With
nothing but a vast ocean to start with, we
shall find, at the conclusion, nothing more
articulate and rational than an infinite expanse
of water to end with.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_336"></a>[336]</span></p>

<p>Herbert Spencer, “the heir of all the
ages in the foremost files of time,” took as
the starting point of his philosophy the unknowable.
In the selection of a first principle,
however, we think Thales, though
the first philosopher who ever lived, had
the advantage of him.</p>

<p>Water is a definite and positive somewhat;
the unknowable is an indefinite and
inarticulate vacuity. With water for a first
principle, the prospect is certain destruction
in a general deluge. With the unknowable
for a first principle, the prospect
is sure imbecility in universal ignorance.
It is better to be drowned in water than to
have the light of intelligence put out in
everlasting night. Mr. Spencer’s unknowable
was a convenient receptacle into which
to dump difficulties and troublesome problems;
but, as a working hypothesis, it was
not sufficient even to build the universe
Mr. Spencer saw. In the process of constructing<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_337"></a>[337]</span>
his system, Mr. Spencer gave to
his unknowable nearly all the attributes
which theologians give to a personal God.
As we have already seen, when Mr. Spencer
got through with drawing from his unknowable
all that he had to have to give
his system the order and show of reason, it
was found that the unknowable part of the
unknowable had about been scattered in
the light of knowledge. For this same unknowable
was found to have Being, Power,
Activity, Causal Energy, and Omnipresence
for attributes. Nothing more can come
out of a first principle than what is contained
in it. Out of water, nothing but
water comes, and out of the unknowable,
nothing but the unknowable comes. One
can posit an acorn, under certain conditions
of soil and sky, and get an oak; but the
germ of the oak must be in the acorn, and
the nutriment of the oak must be in the
conditions before any oak can come out.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_338"></a>[338]</span>
It is the old truism, that “out of nothing,
nothing comes.” No one ever attempts to
account for anything without a first principle.
The test of the reality and value of
a first principle will be determined solely
by its capacity to account for the facts
which come out of it. It is because the
unknowable fails to account for the facts
of nature, and for self-consciousness, self-determination,
and self-activity in man, who
stands as the complete consummation and
realization of nature, that it is not accepted
as an adequate first principle.</p>

<p>Matthew Arnold, in order to escape the
objections which he had to taking a self-conscious,
self-determining, personal God
for a first principle, substituted “The
Stream of Tendency, not ourselves, that
makes for righteousness.” But this sentence,
when analyzed, reveals the fact that
Matthew Arnold’s Stream has about the
same essential elements the theologian supposes<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_339"></a>[339]</span>
to reside in God. A stream has a
source, a direction, and an end. Here, then,
we have cause, means, and ultimate object.
It is also said that the stream makes for
something; here is self-determination. It
is said to make for righteousness; here is
the attribute of Justice, and justice can
only be predicated of a person.</p>

<p>Given nature, with its elements, laws,
and unity, and man as the being in whom
the whole of nature is summed up, with
self-consciousness, self-determination, and
self-activity; the only first principle sufficient
to account for the facts is a self-conscious,
self-determining, self-active personal
God. It is only such a first principle that
is large enough to account for the number,
and order, and drift, and collocations of
the facts; and to such a first principle the
number, and order, and drift, and collocations
of the facts may be traced.</p>

<p>If we see red and violet and blue colors<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_340"></a>[340]</span>
appearing in the carpet on one side of the
loom, we are warranted in assuming that
red and violet and blue threads are entering
the carpet on the other side of the
loom. Nature is a marvelous loom. At
first there are simple elements, then
there are compounds, then there are
plants, then there are animals. At last all
the elements, as so many strands, with
their manifold hues and variegated colors,
appear in the life of man. Man is the
harbor where all the freight, started on its
stormy course at creation, comes to shore.
Its matter takes majestic form in his body,
its power lends itself as wind to his sail,
as heat to his engine, as light to his street:
its truth is arranged by the intellect into
literature and science: its law is formulated
into statutes, enactments, and constitutions:
its beauty is built into oratorios
and spread in radiant visions: its love is
accepted and turned into tenderness, and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_341"></a>[341]</span>
sacrifice, and hope. Infinite personality at
the beginning, self-conscious, self-determining,
and self-active. Finite personality
at the conclusion, self-conscious, self-determining,
and self-active.</p>

<p>If you call the process evolution, then
no more has been evolved than was involved.
If you prefer direct creation,
then nothing is seen in the creature that
was not built into him by the Creator.
Either way, if a self-conscious, self-determining,
and self-active man appears on
one side of nature, a self-conscious, self-determining,
and self-active personal God
is, we may know, on the other.</p>

<h3>I.</h3>

<p>The importance of a correct first principle,
and of a right idea of the nature of
that first principle, cannot be urged too
strongly. In the right solution of the
question we are considering, everything<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_342"></a>[342]</span>
depends on it. If we start with water, as
Thales did, we will be forced to conclude
that individual lives, like bubbles, will
eventually fall back and mingle with the
waves of the sea.</p>

<p>If we start with the unknowable, as
Spencer did, we shall be led to see that
human spirits will lose themselves at
death, as candles lose their light when the
wicks are consumed.</p>

<p>It is not left us, however, arbitrarily to
assume such a first principle as comports
with the particular theory of life it is our
purpose to establish. The first principle
that corresponds to reality is already
implicit in the facts, the origin, and
purpose, and end of which we wish to
know. The law of gravity is implicit in
falling bodies, and in the revolving stars.
The sunbeam is implicit in the growing
tree. All that happens when one posits a
first principle that is not implicit in the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_343"></a>[343]</span>
facts he is considering, is that his first
principle will fail to account for the facts.
Matthew Arnold had a perfect right to
assume as a first principle, “The Stream
of Tendency, not ourselves, that makes for
righteousness.” This looked poetic and
impersonal, and in his esteem served him
as a working hypothesis.</p>

<p>It never seemed to occur to him that
his principle implied the same elements
and attributes the theologians regarded as
uniting in God; the elements and attributes
he was so anxious to get rid of.
Herbert Spencer, with a theory to work
out, and a particular system to buttress
and bolster, devised and adopted a first
principle that seemed to promise most to
his peculiar views. This he had a right to
do. But he had no right to take as a first
principle the unknowable, with which to
destroy the Christian’s God; and just as
soon as he had accomplished this to his<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_344"></a>[344]</span>
entire satisfaction, to turn deliberately and
take nearly every attribute of the Christian’s
God to bestow upon his unknowable.
It is hardly to be supposed that
Mr. Spencer, with malice aforethought
planned the death of God in order to
steal his attributes. The more charitable
view is to suppose that at the outset his
intention was to erect an absolutely new
philosophic edifice, upon a new and original
foundation. To do this, it was
necessary to clear the ground of everything
in sight. So in a high moment of philosophic
self-confidence, he determined on the
obliteration of all previous and time-honored
first principles, that he might
posit one of his own making and to his
own liking.</p>

<p>This was the destructive stage of his
mental movement, and it did not occur to
him that many of the elements he was
clearing away in such wholesale fashion<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_345"></a>[345]</span>
would be necessary to carry up his new
philosophic temple. When he got through
with the period of preparation, he had
nothing to start with but a plain, simple,
empty, unknowable. But it soon became
evident that the unknowable must have
some content, in order to support a decent
and orderly structure. At this point he
took the attributes of the Christian’s God,
Being, Power, Activity, Causal Energy,
Omnipresence, and filled up his empty
unknowable with them. Then he proceeded
with his work.</p>

<h3>II.</h3>

<p>In starting with a self-conscious, self-determining
and personal God, then, as
a first principle that accommodates and
insures the immortality of the individual
spirit, we are only beginning with what is
implicit in the facts of nature and human
life. Let it be clearly apprehended that<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_346"></a>[346]</span>
the ground of the self-conscious, self-determining,
personal God is thought. That the
fundamental and first thing in this universe
is mind. That the being of God is
secondary to the mind, or thought of God.
God has being, because he has thought,
and not thought, because he has being.
The trouble with the pantheistic system of
Spinoza was that he looked upon God,
first as infinite substance or being, while
thought was only one of the modes of
this being, and extension was the other.
The root of all doubt and skepticism is to
be traced to a confused notion of the
nature of God. Many speak of God as
the Supreme Being, and advertise by their
language that in their esteem God is diffused
nebulosity, or universally extended
externality. There never was a skeptic in
the world who had come to the rational
and tenable position, that God is primarily,
and fundamentally, and essentially thought.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_347"></a>[347]</span>
We may properly speak of his being, his
wisdom, his justice, his truth, his love;
but these are different determinations of
his thought. God’s being is the externality
of his thought. His wisdom is his
thought devising means to ends. His
justice is his thought balancing and regulating.
His truth is his thought in
realization. His love is his thought in
sacrifice. “In the beginning was the
Word.” A word is an expressed thought.
“The Word was with God.” The realized
thought or word was with God, the
Eternal Thinker, or Thought. “God said,
Let there be light, and there was light.”
Light was thus the expression of thought.
Nearly all materialism and pantheism look
upon things as an emanation from something.
Vapor emanates from the surface
of a river, and is only the river in diffusion.
But the universe does not emanate
from God; it is the direct creation and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_348"></a>[348]</span>
expression of his thought. Potentially the
universe was always in the thought of
God.</p>

<h3>III.</h3>

<p>We have dwelt at length on the self-consciousness
and self-determination of God,
as these unite in him as an absolute personality,
for the reason that the immortality of
the human spirit finds its condition and its
security here. If God is a person, and
self-conscious, self-determining, and self-active,
man is immortal, for in him the
elements which constitute the essential
nature of God appear. Man is a person
and a spirit, made in the likeness and
image of God. He is, therefore, as imperishable
and indestructible as God is. He
has thought and is therefore self-conscious;
he has a will, and is therefore self-determining;
he has power, and is therefore
self-active; he maintains his identity
through change, and is therefore a person.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_349"></a>[349]</span>
But the finite person finds his life through
the infinite Person. He finds his knowledge
by partaking of truth, the realized
thought of God; he finds his freedom by
the observance of law, the expressed will
of God; he finds his peace by partaking
of the life that was in Christ, the manifested
love of God. As the fundamental
and prior thing in the being of God is
thought, so the fundamental and prior
thing in the being of man is thought.
His progress in the practical matters of
life will be in proportion to his thought.
His political status will be in proportion
to his thought; his religious attainment
will be in proportion to his thought.
Schleiermacher said “Feeling is the
source of religion—a feeling of dependence.”
But one cannot have a feeling of
dependence without having the thought of
dependence. One cannot feel that he depends
unless he thinks of himself as dependent.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_350"></a>[350]</span>
Matthew Arnold said that religion
was morality touched by emotion.
But there cannot be morality without the
thought of some rule by which conduct
ought to be guided. Even the African
savage, who worships a snake, thinks there
is something in the snake entitled to
his adoration. Thought is the clearest
self-explication of the human spirit. In
thought it comes to itself and knows itself.
Take thought out of the spirit of man,
and you take out its essential nature. Its
immortality, even were it possible, would
then not be worth contending for. One
had as well be blotted out, as to lose the
only element of his spirit by which he is
able to recognize himself as such. Looking
upon thought as the center and kernel
of the human spirit, we see that to deny
the immortality of the human spirit is to
assume that thought is destructible; and
this is a flat contradiction, for destruction<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_351"></a>[351]</span>
has no meaning, except in relation to
thought. It is of the very nature of
thought to be eternal. No thought ever
dies, or can die. All the determinations of
God’s thought are eternal. The mind of
God has within it all determinations of
thought; those past, those present, and
those to come. Some of these determinations
of the divine thought have taken the
form of objects in the inorganic world,
some have taken the form of objects in the
vegetable kingdom, and some have taken
the form of objects in the animal kingdom.
The determinations of thought, of which
inorganic things, trees, and animals were
the expressions, are all eternal.</p>

<p>It is of the nature of the things in
which the determinations of thought took
form to change and pass away. But the
ideal patterns, of which they were only the
temporary forms, are held in the mind of
God forever. The house which expresses<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_352"></a>[352]</span>
the architect’s ideal may be blown away, or
burned up, but the ideal in the thought
of the architect cannot be blown away or
burned up. Now in man the determination
of God’s thought is not expressed in a
thing, but in a thought. Man, as God’s
child, inherits, or comes through creation
into the possession of thought, of mind, so
that he is able to set up thinking—in his
own behalf, and by the self-determining, self-conscious,
and self-active power of his own
mind. God as thought is his own object
and his own subject, and man as thought
is his own object and his own subject.
God has set him up to housekeeping in the
republic of thought.</p>

<p>In the changes which take place in material
objects, there is preservation of the
species, but the loss of the individual.
The object is an element and not a self.
When it changes, it is by something external
to itself, and in changing, realizes its<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_353"></a>[353]</span>
nature. It is indifferent to change, as
there is no central self that retains its
essential identity in the midst of all change.
The tree belongs to a higher order of existence
than a rock. It is the expression
of unconscious life. The animal belongs
to a still higher plane than the tree. Besides
appropriating food from its environment, as
does the tree, it takes in the images of
things, and lives a low order of sentient
life. But in order that animals may take
in the images of things through the senses,
the things must be present before them.
When the thing is gone, the image fades.
The objects which stand around man in his
environment pass into his consciousness
through the senses. But when the environment
changes and the objects are taken
away, the impressions made by the objects
remain. In this way man re-creates the
universe for his own thought. The gurgling
of brooks, the murmur of the sea, the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_354"></a>[354]</span>
sighing of the winds, the cooing of doves,
he hears just as the animal does. But
away from brooks, and seas, and winds, and
doves, Beethoven throws into one of his
symphonies all the notes that were ever on
sea or land. He has within him the same
kind of mind that expressed itself in all
the notes of music, and he not only hears
these notes, but he re-combines and reorganizes
them in his great compositions.</p>

<h3>IV.</h3>

<p>The spirit of man is simple. It is an
ultimate and indivisible unity. Death
divides, breaks up, and disintegrates. The
nature of the human spirit is such, however,
that it cannot be divided, broken up,
or disintegrated. We see it maintain its
identity through the storms and mutations
of eighty years. All things change about
it. The very body that constitutes its
temporary abiding place is torn down and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_355"></a>[355]</span>
rebuilt many times in the course of a long
life. It advances in knowledge and experience;
grows larger and richer in hope
and love, but all its accumulations of
thought and increasing wealth of life are
stored in the same self-conscious, self-determining,
personal spirit. In the evening
of life the old man sits in the midst of his
grandchildren and recounts the scenes of
his boyhood days. All the waves of time
contained within the sweep of three score
years and ten have left their labels of drift
and storm on the shores of his life. But
they have not worn, or wasted, or altered
his spirit.</p>

<p>A rock wears away, or is crumbled to
dust, when it is a rock no longer. A tree
is cut down and split into cord wood and
burned in the engine, and it is a tree no
longer. In the furnace it is turned back
into its original elements. In the fire it is
altered or othered. The other of a tree is<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_356"></a>[356]</span>
oxygen, hydrogen, etc. The bird in the
thicket is shot by the heartless sportsman.
It falls to the ground and its little heart
ceases to beat. Soon its body is changed
back into earth and air. The other of a
bird is not a bird, but the particles which
were organized under the process of natural
law to form its body. The images which
fell on its vision in the grove, faded away
when the objects which caused them were
removed. The sounds which came to its
ears from here and there in the forest
passed from its sense when the air that
caused them ceased to vibrate. In the
bird there was no inner self, abiding, self-conscious,
determining, and active, that
was capable of grasping and holding and
recreating the visions and the notes which
came to it. It may have had a sort of sentient
consciousness, but it was not much
above the consciousness of the sea, which
holds the images of the stars in its dark<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_357"></a>[357]</span>
blue waves, as long as they stand above
it.</p>

<p>By comparing man with the classes of
individuals below him, we may see the
respects in which he rises infinitely above
them. And we may see, too, by this comparison,
that immortality is not something
to which man is to come beyond death, but
something that he has already in the very
constitution of the personal spirit. The
same may be said of man’s body, that is
said of the bodies of trees and birds, its
other is the original elements which compose
it. The life in a tree cannot other itself, because
it is not conscious. The life in a bird
cannot other itself because its consciousness
is not self-consciousness. But in man’s body
there resides a spirit that can other itself.
Man, as a personal spirit, can project himself
out of himself, and reason with himself and
commune with himself. The self he projects
out of himself is another self, but not<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_358"></a>[358]</span>
a different self. The other of man’s spirit,
then, is not something else, but it is the
same spirit. Man is subject and object,
active and passive, determiner and determined.
Man, as subject, may externalize
himself, and thus make of himself his own
object, and by this self-separation enrich
himself and advance within himself.
Beethoven, as a thinking subject, objectified
his thought in the symphonies, and
thus regaled and thrilled his own spirit.
By putting his own thought into the form
of sound waves, it came back to him in the
rain, and storm, and thunder, and sigh, and
murmur of music. As a thinking subject
Raphael objectified his own thought in the
transfiguration, and thus had it come back
to him in a vision as immortal as the spirit
that created it. Michael Angelo objectified
his own thought in the Last Judgment,
and by this self-separation of his spirit,
advertised its indestructibility. Homer, as<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_359"></a>[359]</span>
a thinking subject, objectified his thought
into the Iliad. This great epic poem has
already lived, even on this side of the
grave, where the order is change and decay,
nearly three thousand years. Are we to
conclude that a personal spirit that could
deposit itself in numbers never to die, was
itself subject to dissolution? This would
be to have an effect greater than the cause.
The sunbeam may deposit itself in a tree,
and thus secure to itself life in embodied
form for hundreds of years. But in order
that this may be, the sun must send his
beams to warm and nourish the tree all
the days of its life. The Iliad has lived,
however, nearly three thousand years,
without the daily ministrations of Homer’s
spirit. For a bubble on the sea of life to
lift itself into imperishable form and then
fall back to mingle with the waves and the
waters, is to contradict the principle of the
correlation of forces, which declares that<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_360"></a>[360]</span>
action and reaction must always be equal.
The expression a spirit makes of itself cannot
be more enduring than the spirit itself.</p>

<p>When a train of cars stops suddenly at
the depot, the energy that caused it to fly
along the track is not lost, it is only transformed.
When a tree is cut down, the
energy that expressed itself in its trunk
and branches is not lost, it will only take
other forms. When a horse dies, the energy
of which its life was the expression<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_361"></a>[361]</span>
is not lost, it is transformed. When a
tree or a horse passes from the living world
into the world of inorganic things, the
exact amount of energy in the body of the
living tree or horse takes other forms.
The amount on the side of death is equal
to the amount on the side of life. If we
consider man only as a physical organism,
the same may be said of him. The amount
transformed into earth and air, will be the
equivalent of the organized fund of bone,
and sinew, and muscle, turned over to
death. If we thus estimate man, however,
as we do a tree or a horse, have we taken
into account the entire sum of assets that
were in his possession during life? What
of his thought, affection, and volition?
When Kepler died, what became of the
intelligence that discovered the “Three
Laws,” which constitute the arches of the
sublime bridge that spans the vast chasm
between Ptolemaic and modern astronomy?<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_362"></a>[362]</span>
When Laplace died, what became of the
spirit that solved the problems of the Mécanique
Céleste, by the aid of which the
irregularities of the heavenly bodies were
reduced to order? When Adams died,
what became of the massive spirit that
built in the depths of his own study the
planet Neptune, with no other raw material
to work from than the perturbations of
Uranus? When Moses died, what became
of the affection that expressed itself in the
training and civilization of a race? When
Jesus Christ died, what became of the love
that sacrificed itself for a sinful world?</p>

<p>When we begin to talk about human life,
we find all that has made civilization is not
physical. In the death of human beings,
the energies of thought, and affection, and
volition are not represented in the transformations
which take place with reference to
their bodies. Yet all the energies man has
put forth that give any evidence of his<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_363"></a>[363]</span>
record on the earth are such as come from
thought, and affection, and volition. As
these energies are not transformed at death,
as are the forces of the body, they must
continue. For to suppose they ceased at
death would be to break the law of the
correlation and the conservation of forces.
If they are not transformed at death, along
with the forces of the body, they must reside
in another than the material world,
and must not, therefore, be subject to its
changes.</p>

<h3>V.</h3>

<p>The personal spirit, by its very nature,
and tendencies, and possibilities, seems to be
addressed to another than the tangible,
local, and physical realm in which it finds
itself while residing in the body. An irrepressible
and wide-reaching something in
the spirit of each man seems to impel him
to triumph over space, and time, and change.
In the accumulation of property, he would<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_364"></a>[364]</span>
own the whole world. A very small portion
of land would be adequate to his
physical needs. But he would add acre
to acre, till his private domain compassed
the surface of the whole earth. Alexander,
weeping because there was not another
world he could get to conquer, advertises
the immensity and illimitability
of the human spirit. By the aid of instruments
by which man has augmented and
lengthened his power of vision, he has
come upon stars rolling in the immensity
of space to the circle of the thirteenth
magnitude. He has not been content to
look upon the stars in the vast depths of
space, but he has photographed them, so
as to behold their faces in his study. Back
beyond the dim dawn of time, commensurate
with the appearance of human life on
earth, he has gone, to return with the chemical,
physical, and stratigraphical history of
the globe. By the aid of steam, he has<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_365"></a>[365]</span>
made himself a cosmopolite, and through
the application of electricity, he has made
himself ubiquitous. Must we not posit a
spirit correlated to the universal to account
for this disposition to compass all things,
to know all things, and to be everywhere?
The tendency of the human spirit to compass
and possess universality is seen, too,
by its capacity to create language, in which
it embodies all things and through which
it expresses its thought of all things. If
there had to be separate words for all individual
things any but the most limited
knowledge would be impossible, and such
knowledge alone there would be if man
was shut up to atomic sensations for the
data of knowledge. But the mind, by
its creative, combining power, and its
active spontaneous insight, forms words
which represent not only individual things,
but classes and species of things. Man devises
the word <i>oak</i>, and lets it stand for all<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_366"></a>[366]</span>
the oaks in the world. He creates the
word <i>humanity</i>, and puts into it the whole
human race. He coins the word <i>vegetable</i>,
and uses it to define the whole kingdom of
plants. Thus he not only goes over the
world and sees it directly, but he produces
language manifold and complicated, and
elastic enough to accommodate and contain
the world, with all that is in it. This
makes it possible for him to go round the
world and see all its wonders, without
leaving the place of his birth.</p>

<p>He not only builds for himself the universe
in language, so that he can contemplate
its moons, and measure its suns, and
sail its oceans, and climb its mountains in
the silent precincts of his study, but he
avails himself of sound and light, also, to
give expression to universal ideas. He
takes a few notes, and so combines and
mixes them as to be able to touch all the
chords of the universal human heart in one<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_367"></a>[367]</span>
song. Michael Angelo put all the theology
of all the books into the Last Judgment.</p>

<p>Throughout the length and breadth of
nature, there is economy of faculty and resource
until we come to man. The fish
has not a gill nor a fin too many, and there
is not in the water where he lives any surplus
or margin upon which he does not
make levies for his life.</p>

<p>The wings and tail and bones of the bird
are all necessary to his poise and circle in
the sky. The same economy is found in
the atmosphere through which the bird
flies. It is none too heavy and none too
light. But when we come to man, we find
that margin and surplus is the rule. He
has a surplus of faculty and a surplus of resource,
a surplus of endowment and a surplus
of environment. He finds it necessary
to make levies on hardly any of himself to
get along in this world, at least as far as
his natural wants are concerned. What<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_368"></a>[368]</span>
would be the use for a carpenter to have
all the tools necessary to build St. Peter’s
at Rome, if his only work was to put up a
tent for a week’s camping excursion in the
woods? Why have an engine with a million
horse power to run a flutter mill?</p>

<p>With the animal there is changing endowment
and changing environment.
Limitations are clear and distinct within
and without. But with man there is infinite
environment. Within he has a self-determining
spirit, subject and object,
bound together in a simple and indissoluble
unity. Surrounding this spirit, infinite
in structure and capacity, is infinite truth,
infinite law, and infinite love. Even Herbert
Spencer said “Perfect correspondence
would be perfect life. Were there no
changes in the environment but such as
the organism had adapted changes to meet,
and were it never to fail in the efficiency
with which it met them, there would be<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_369"></a>[369]</span>
eternal existence, and eternal knowledge.”
In the personal spirit and the elements
which surround it, we have the two eternal
terms of eternal correspondence. A
self-determining spirit is essentially, structurally,
and constitutionally imperishable.
It others itself only through its own act.
And the other of itself is itself. It is its
own subject and its own object. When
it goes out of itself, it is itself that goes
out. It is a complete circle, an absolute
and indestructible individuation.
It is the final expression of God’s creative
power. Through all the revolutions and
mutations of time, this was the destined
goal. The destruction of a human spirit
would register the death of God. It is
the direct expression of the spirit of God,
and bears his own likeness and image, and
has for the guarantee of its permanence
the person of the eternal God himself.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_370"></a>[370]</span></p>

<h3>VI.</h3>

<p>Rev. Edward White of England, Dr. E.
Petavel of France, and Dr. Lyman Abbott
of America, have denied what Dr. Abbott
is pleased to call facultative immortality.
Immortality, in their esteem, is an importation
from without. It is the claim of
Locke, and Hume, and Mill, and Spencer,
that knowledge is an importation from the
realm of sensation. Their war was upon
the knowing faculties. From the domain
of philosophy the conflict has passed up to
the plane of religion, and we now have
the attack made upon the self-determining
spirit. In the sensational philosophy, we
have seen all things dissolved. It not
only makes it impossible to rationally believe
in God, but also in mind, and self, and
external world. The sensational philosophy
got the object of knowledge by a process
that destroyed the subject of knowledge,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_371"></a>[371]</span>
so this irrational theory of Dr. Lyman
Abbot would secure the object of
life by the destruction of the subject of
life. We know that the raw material
of knowledge is found in the objective
world, but unless the mind has the inherent
combining, active power to take this
raw material and organize it into an orderly
system, then the individual can never
know anything. There being in the mind
no master of ceremonies, no director and
referee, the tramp and vagabond sensations
may wander in and wander out at their
sweet will. They would come in with their
own opinions and go out with their own
opinions. There being no head of the
house within, the tramps could have it all
their own way.</p>

<p>Knowledge, beginning out of the mind,
would have its cause and end out of the
mind. Beginning with matter, knowledge
could be resolved back into matter.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_372"></a>[372]</span></p>

<p>We believe the life in which the human
spirit is to realize its nature fully and harmoniously
was embodied in Jesus Christ,
who was the word made flesh.</p>

<p>But it is because the spirit of man is
essentially indestructible, that it has power
to take hold of this life and assimilate it.
If it refuses this divine embodiment of life,
it brings disorder, and confusion, and everlasting
sorrow to itself, but not destruction.
The self-determining spirit is in its structure
and constitution up to the style of
life offered it in the Son of Man and the
Son of God. In finding the life that was
in Christ, it finds its own life, and enters
the path of everlasting progress.</p>
